1. Set up the equation based on the given information: \( AMC10 + AMC12 = 123422 \). This means we can express \( AMC10 \) and \( AMC12 \) in terms of their digits: \( AMC10 = 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10 \) and \( AMC12 = 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12 \).

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:

1. Take the logarithm of both sides of each equation to express \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) in terms of logarithms. For example:
   - From \(4^a = 5\), we can write \(a = \frac{\log 5}{\log 4}\).
   - From \(5^b = 6\), we can write \(b = \frac{\log 6}{\log 5}\).
   - From \(6^c = 7\), we can write \(c = \frac{\log 7}{\log 6}\).
   - From \(7^d = 8\), we can write \(d = \frac{\log 8}{\log 7}\).

2. Next, substitute these expressions for \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) into the product \(abcd\) to find:
   \[
   abcd = \left(\frac{\log 5}{\log 4}\right) \left(\frac{\log 6}{\log 5}\right) \left(\frac{\log 7}{\log 6}\right) \left(\frac{\log 8}{\log 7}\right).

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:

1. Find the units digit of each individual term: \(16^{17}\), \(17^{18}\), and \(18^{19}\). This can be achieved by looking at the units digits of the bases:
   - The units digit of \(16\) is \(6\).
   - The units digit of \(17\) is \(7\).
   - The units digit of \(18\) is \(8\).

2. Calculate the units digit of each power:
   - For \(16^{17}\): The units digit of \(6^n\) is always \(6\) for \(n \geq 1\), so the units digit of \(16^{17}\) is \(6\).
   - For \(17^{18}\): The units digits of powers of \(7\) cycle every 4 (i.e., \(7, 9, 3, 1\)). Calculate \(18 \mod 4\) to find the relevant position in the cycle.
   - For \(18^{19}\): The units digits of powers of \(8\) also cycle every 4 (i.e., \(8, 4, 2, 6\)). Calculate \(19 \mod 4\) to find the relevant position in the cycle.

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:

1. First, I will find the units digit of each term in the expression: \(16^{17}\), \(17^{18}\), and \(18^{19}\). To do this, I will calculate each base's units digit raised to their respective powers.

2. For \(16^{17}\), since the units digit of 16 is 6, I will determine the pattern of the units digits of powers of 6. The units digits of powers of 6 are always 6. Thus, the units digit of \(16^{17}\) is 6.

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:
1. Since $X$ is 2 more than a multiple of 3, we can express this as $X = 3k + 2$ for some integer $k$. This means that $X$ can take values such as 2, 5, 8, 11, etc.
2. Next, we analyze the condition regarding the units digit. We know that $X$ must have the same units digit as a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5. Therefore, we can express this as $Y = 5m + 4$ for some integer $m$, which gives possible units digits of $4$ or $9$ (because $Y$ can end in 4 or 9, depending on the value of $m$).

1. Use the change of base formula for logarithms to rewrite both terms in the expression: 
   \[
   \frac{\log_2 80}{\log_{40} 2} = \frac{\log_2 80}{\frac{1}{\log_2 40}} = \log_2 80 \cdot \log_2 40

   \frac{\log_2 160}{\log_{20} 2} = \frac{\log_2 160}{\frac{1}{\log_2 20}} = \log_2 160 \cdot \log_2 20.
   \]

2. Simplify \(\log_2 80\), \(\log_2 160\), \(\log_2 40\), and \(\log_2 20\) using properties of logarithms, such as \(\log_2(ab) = \log_2 a + \log_2 b\).
   - For example, \(\log_2 80 = \log_2 (16 \cdot 5) = \log_2 16 + \log_2 5\).
