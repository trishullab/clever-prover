To implement the `truncate_number` function in Lean 4, we can follow these detailed steps:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to decompose a positive floating-point number into its integer and decimal parts. The integer part is the largest integer smaller than the given number, and the decimal part is what remains after subtracting the integer part from the original number.

2. **Function Signature**: According to the provided signature, our function will take a positive floating point number (`Rat`) as input and will return the decimal part of this number, also as a `Rat`.

3. **Define the Implementation**:
   - Start by using the `floor` function to determine the integer part of the number. The `floor` function gives the largest integer less than or equal to the number.
   - Subtract this integer part from the original number to obtain the decimal part.
   - The result must be verified to be non-negative and less than 1.

4. **Implement the Function**:
   - Create the function `implementation` that takes a parameter `number: Rat`.
   - Inside the function, compute the integer part using `number.floor`.
   - Then compute the decimal part by subtracting the integer part from `number`.
   - Ensure to return the computed decimal part.

5. **Check Precondition**: Before executing the core logic, confirm that the `number` is greater than 0. If not, handle it gracefully or assume the input will always be positive based on the problem constraints.

6. **Testing**: Utilize the provided test case to check if the function works correctly by inputting `3.5` and expecting the output `0.5`.

7. **Edge Cases**: Consider potential edge cases:
   - Very small positive numbers (e.g., `0.1`, `0.001`) to ensure it still returns the correct decimal part.
   - The situation where `number` is a whole number (e.g., `4.0` should return `0.0`).

8. **Final Touches**: Once the function works correctly and passes all tests, finalize the implementation by cleaning up any unnecessary code or comments.

Here is an outline of what the code might look like:

```lean
def implementation (number: Rat) : Rat :=
  if number > 0 then
    let int_part := number.floor
    let decimal_part := number - int_part
    decimal_part
  else
    -- Handle error case if necessary, but the problem states number is positive
    0  -- Placeholder for handling case where number is not positive
```

This provides a clear structure for implementing the function and ensures compliance with the problem specifications while allowing for robust testing and validation.

[LEMMA PLAN]
Prove a `implementation_positive_and_floor` lemma that states that for any positive `number`, the integer part of `number` (obtained using `number.floor`) is less than `number`, and the difference between `number` and `number.floor` is the decimal part which is positive and less than 1.
  - The proof can be done directly using properties of the floor function and definitions of positive numbers.
[LEMMA]
lemma implementation_positive_and_floor
(number: Rat)
(h_positive: 0 < number)
: number.floor < number ∧
0 < number - number.floor ∧
number - number.floor < 1 := by
sorry
[END]

[LEMMA PLAN]
Prove a `implementation_decimal_part` lemma that states that the output of the implementation function when given a positive number is equal to the decimal part of that number.
  - Use the definition of the implementation function directly and apply the results of the `implementation_positive_and_floor` lemma.
[LEMMA]
lemma implementation_decimal_part
(number: Rat)
(h_positive: 0 < number)
: implementation number = number - number.floor := by
sorry
[END]

[CORRECTNESS PLAN]
Prove the `correctness` theorem.
  - Start by unfolding the `problem_spec` and assign the output of the `implementation` function to a temporary variable `result`.
  - Use the `implementation_positive_and_floor` lemma to establish properties of the input `number`.
  - Use the `implementation_decimal_part` lemma to directly relate `result` with `number` and show that it satisfies the conditions in the `spec`.
  - Conclude the proof by asserting that the conditions in the `spec` hold for the `result`.
