To implement the `below_zero` function in Lean 4, I will follow these detailed steps:

1. **Define the Function Signature**: Start by defining the `implementation` function with the correct signature that accepts a list of integers (`operations: List Int`) and returns a boolean (`Bool`).

2. **Initialize Balance**: Create a variable to hold the current balance, initialized to zero. This will be updated as we iterate through the list of operations.

3. **Iterate Through Operations**: Use a loop or recursion to go through each operation in the list. For each operation:
   - **Update Balance**: Add the operation (which could be a deposit or a withdrawal) to the current balance.
   - **Check for Below Zero**: After updating the balance, check if it has fallen below zero. If it has, immediately return `true`.

4. **Complete Iteration**: If the loop completes without the balance dropping below zero, return `false`.

5. **Consider Edge Cases**: Ensure to handle empty lists correctly, which should return `false` since there are no operations to cause a drop below zero.

6. **Testing the Function**: After the implementation, I will run the provided test cases to verify that the function works as expected. This includes cases where the balance should not go below zero and cases where it does.

Here’s how I would implement the function in Lean 4:

```lean
def implementation (operations: List Int) : Bool :=
  let rec loop (balance : Int) (ops : List Int) : Bool :=
    match ops with
    | [] => false  -- No operations left, balance has never gone below zero
    | op :: rest =>
      let new_balance := balance + op  -- Update the balance
      if new_balance < 0 then
        true  -- Balance has gone below zero, return true
      else
        loop new_balance rest  -- Continue with the remaining operations
  loop 0 operations  -- Start with a balance of 0 and the full list of operations
```

This implementation defines a recursive helper function `loop` that processes each operation and checks the balance, adhering to the problem's requirements. After defining the function, I will proceed to run the tests to ensure its correctness.

[LEMMA PLAN]
Prove a `loop_balance_invariant` lemma that states that the balance at any step during the execution of `implementation.loop` can be expressed in terms of the operations that have been applied up to that step.
  - Use induction on the list of operations to show that the balance after processing the first `i` operations is equal to the sum of those operations.
[LEMMA]
lemma loop_balance_invariant
(operations: List Int)
(balance: Int)
(ops: List Int)
: ∀ i, i ≤ ops.length →
  (ops.take i).sum + balance = (loop 0 ops).balance := by
sorry
[END]

[LEMMA PLAN]
Prove a `loop_below_zero_condition` lemma that states if the balance falls below zero at some operation, then the result returned by `implementation.loop` is true.
  - Use induction on the list of operations, analyzing the case when the balance goes below zero and when it does not.
[LEMMA]
lemma loop_below_zero_condition
(operations: List Int)
(balance: Int)
(ops: List Int)
: (∃ i, i ≤ ops.length ∧ (ops.take i).sum < 0) →
  implementation.loop balance ops = true := by
sorry
[END]

[LEMMA PLAN]
Prove a `loop_non_negative_condition` lemma that states that if the balance never goes below zero, the result returned by `implementation.loop` is false.
  - Use induction on the list of operations to show that if no prefix of operations results in a negative balance, then the function will eventually return false.
[LEMMA]
lemma loop_non_negative_condition
(operations: List Int)
(balance: Int)
(ops: List Int)
: (¬∃ i, i ≤ ops.length ∧ (ops.take i).sum < 0) →
  implementation.loop balance ops = false := by
sorry
[END]

[CORRECTNESS PLAN]
To prove the `correctness` theorem, I will start by unfolding the `problem_spec` definition and assigning the implementation's output to a temporary variable `result`.
  - First, I will analyze the case when the result is true, using the `loop_below_zero_condition` lemma to establish that there exists an index `i` such that the sum of operations up to that index is negative, confirming the specification.
  - Next, I will analyze the case when the result is false. I will apply the `loop_non_negative_condition` lemma to show that if the result is false, then all prefixes of the operations must yield a non-negative balance.
  - Conclusively, I will show that the overall result of `implementation` adheres to the specification defined in `problem_spec`, thus proving the theorem.
