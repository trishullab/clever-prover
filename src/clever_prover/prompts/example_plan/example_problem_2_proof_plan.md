Prove the `correctness` theorem.
  - Start by unfolding the `problem_spec` and assigning the implementation's output to a temporary variable `result`.
  - Early on, you will want to break the proof up into cases based on whether `x` is positive, negative, or zero.
  - Many of the intermediate goals can likely be proven using `linarith`.
