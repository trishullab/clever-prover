Prove the `correctness` theorem.
  - Start by unfolding the `problem_spec` and assigning the implementation's output to a temporary variable `result`.
  - Simplify the goal.
  - Use the `have` keyword to create a new hypothesis equating the operation of squaring a variable to that of multiplying the variable by itself.
  - Use this new hypothesis to rewrite the goal.
