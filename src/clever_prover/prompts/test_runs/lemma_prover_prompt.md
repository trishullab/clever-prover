The instructions below describe a Lean 4 function implementation, a list of zero or more previously-proven lemmas about the function implementation (with their proofs omitted), and a current lemma about the function implementation that needs to be proved.

Along with these is a detailed plan with steps of how to prove the current lemma in Lean 4.

Please write for me a Lean 4 proof of the current lemma, starting with the lemma statement. You may freely use any of the previous lemmas in your proof.

Please respond entirely in Lean 4.
