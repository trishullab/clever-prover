I'll provide a plan for proving the correctness of the `implementation` function for the `below_zero` problem.

[LEMMA PLAN]
Prove a lemma that relates the cumulative sum of the prefix of operations to the final balance during the loop.
  - Show how the balance changes with each iteration
  - Demonstrate how this relates to the sum of the prefix of operations
[LEMMA]
lemma balance_sum_relation 
(operations: List Int)
(init_balance: Int)
: ∀ prefix_len, 
    0 ≤ prefix_len ∧ prefix_len ≤ operations.length → 
    implementation.loop init_balance (operations.take prefix_len) =
    (init_balance + (operations.take prefix_len).sum < 0) := by
sorry
[END]

[LEMMA PLAN]
Prove a lemma showing that if the function returns true, there exists a prefix of operations that leads to a negative balance.
  - Use induction on the list of operations
  - Show how the cumulative balance changes
[LEMMA]
lemma true_implies_negative_balance
(operations: List Int)
(h_true: implementation operations = true)
: ∃ i, 0 < i ∧ i ≤ operations.length ∧ 
       (operations.take i).sum < 0 := by
sorry
[END]

[LEMMA PLAN]
Prove a lemma showing that if no prefix leads to a negative balance, the function returns false.
  - Use induction on the list of operations
  - Show how the cumulative balance remains non-negative
[LEMMA]
lemma false_implies_no_negative_balance
(operations: List Int)
(h_false: implementation operations = false)
: ∀ i, 0 < i ∧ i ≤ operations.length → 
       0 ≤ (operations.take i).sum := by
sorry
[END]

[CORRECTNESS PLAN]
Prove the correctness theorem by breaking it down into two main parts:
1. If the function returns true, there must exist a prefix of operations that leads to a negative balance
   - Use the `true_implies_negative_balance` lemma to show this
2. If the function returns false, no prefix of operations can lead to a negative balance
   - Use the `false_implies_no_negative_balance` lemma to show this
3. Use the `balance_sum_relation` lemma to connect the implementation's loop behavior to the cumulative sum
4. Directly prove that the result satisfies the problem specification by showing equivalence between the implementation's return value and the existence of a negative balance prefix
[END]

This plan follows a structured approach to proving the correctness of the `below_zero` function, breaking down the proof into manageable lemmas that build up to the final correctness theorem. The key steps involve showing the relationship between the cumulative sum of operations and the account balance, and proving the directionality of the function's behavior.
