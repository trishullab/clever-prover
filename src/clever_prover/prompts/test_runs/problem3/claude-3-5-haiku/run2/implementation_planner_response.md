Here's a detailed plan to implement the `below_zero` function in Lean 4:

1. Understanding the Problem:
   - The function takes a list of integer operations (deposits and withdrawals)
   - It needs to track the running balance of an account
   - Return true if the balance becomes negative at any point
   - Return false if the balance never goes below zero

2. High-Level Solution Strategy:
   - Use a fold or recursive approach to track the running balance
   - Check if the balance becomes negative during the process
   - Stop and return true immediately if balance goes below zero
   - Return false if we complete processing all operations without going below zero

3. Implementation Approach:
   - Define a helper function that:
     * Takes the current list of operations
     * Tracks the running sum
     * Checks at each step if the sum has gone negative
   - Use pattern matching or recursion to traverse the list
   - Early return with true if balance becomes negative
   - Return false if list is fully processed without negative balance

4. Detailed Implementation Steps:
   a. Define a recursive helper function with accumulator
   b. Base case: Empty list returns false
   c. Recursive case:
      - Calculate running sum
      - Check if sum is negative
      - If negative, return true
      - If not, continue processing remaining list
   
5. Lean 4 Specific Considerations:
   - Ensure total function (handles all possible inputs)
   - Use pattern matching for list traversal
   - Leverage Lean's strong type system
   - Potentially use `List.foldl` or explicit recursion

6. Proof Obligations:
   - Ensure function terminates
   - Prove it correctly identifies negative balance scenarios
   - Match the provided problem specification

Here's a skeleton of the potential implementation:

```lean
def below_zero (operations: List Int) : Bool :=
  let rec helper (remainingOps: List Int) (currentSum: Int) : Bool :=
    match remainingOps with
    | [] => false
    | x :: xs => 
        let newSum := currentSum + x
        if newSum < 0 then true
        else helper xs newSum
  
  helper operations 0
```

This implementation:
- Starts with initial balance of 0
- Recursively processes operations
- Checks balance after each operation
- Returns true immediately if balance goes negative
- Returns false if all operations complete without negative balance

The implementation satisfies the key requirements:
- Tracks running balance
- Detects first occurrence of negative balance
- Handles lists of any length
- Provides an efficient single-pass solution

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this implementation plan?
