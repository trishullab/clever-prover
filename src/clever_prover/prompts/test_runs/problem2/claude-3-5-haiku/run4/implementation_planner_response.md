Here's a detailed plan for implementing the `truncate_number` function in Lean 4:

1. Understand the Problem Requirements:
   - The function takes a positive rational number as input
   - It should return the decimal part of the number (the part less than 1)
   - The returned value should always be between 0 and 1 (exclusive of 1)

2. Implementation Strategy:
   - Use Lean's built-in floor function to get the integer part of the number
   - Subtract the floor from the original number to get the decimal part

3. Detailed Implementation Steps:
   - First, use `Rat.floor` to get the largest integer less than or equal to the input number
   - Subtract this floor value from the original number
   - This will naturally give the decimal part

4. Potential Implementation Outline:
```lean
def implementation (number: Rat) : Rat :=
  number - number.floor
```

5. Reasoning about Correctness:
   - `number.floor` gives the largest integer less than or equal to `number`
   - Subtracting `number.floor` from `number` will always yield a value between 0 and 1
   - This matches the problem specification exactly

6. Key Considerations:
   - Ensure the function works for positive rational numbers
   - Handle edge cases like whole numbers (which would return 0)
   - Leverage Lean's built-in rational number operations

The implementation is straightforward and directly follows the problem specification, utilizing Lean's rational number operations to extract the decimal part of a number.
