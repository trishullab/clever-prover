# Implementation Plan for the truncate_number Function

The problem requires truncating a rational number to extract its decimal part (the leftover after removing the integer part).

Here's my detailed plan for implementing this function:

1. **Understand the requirements**:
   - We need to extract only the fractional part of a rational number
   - The result should be between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive)
   - The original number should equal its floor plus the result

2. **Determine the mathematical operation**:
   - For any number x, its decimal part is x - floor(x)
   - Where floor(x) is the largest integer less than or equal to x

3. **Implementation approach**:
   - Use the built-in `floor` function from the `Rat` type to get the integer part
   - Subtract this integer part from the original number
   - This difference will represent the decimal component

4. **Check edge cases**:
   - For whole numbers (e.g., 3.0), the result should be 0
   - The function should work for any positive rational number

5. **Final implementation**:
   - Write a single-line implementation that calculates number - number.floor
   - This elegantly extracts just the decimal portion of the number

This approach is both mathematically correct and efficiently implements the requirements of the problem.
