[THOUGHTS]
We need to find absolute value of an integer. 
Since absolute value is always defined for all integers, we don't need to check for any preconditions.
We can write a specification which return x if x is greater than or equal to 0, otherwise -x.
It is also easy to see that program will always terminate for all integers. However, it is better to mention that in the specification.

def coins_won(score_changes: List[int], threshold: int) -> int
"""
In a game, a player's score starts at 0 and is updated round by round using values from the list
score_changes (where positive numbers add to the score and negative numbers subtract).
After each round, as long as the player's cumulative score is greater than or equal to the given threshold,
the player wins a coin for that round.
Your task is to compute and return the total number of coins won by the player by the end of the game.

[THOUGHTS]
The function takes a list of integers and an integer threshold as input. Clearly, the function is not defined for empty list.
We can write a specification which checks if the list is empty and returns 0, otherwise we can check if the score is greater than or equal to threshold. If it is, we can check if the score is greater than or equal to threshold and return 1 + impl on the remaining list and threshold - score. Otherwise, we can return 0. It is important to note that when for a sublist, the score increments by 1, then there is no sublist smaller than the current one which can also increment the score.
