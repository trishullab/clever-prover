This proof is moderately difficult.
We should not generate any helper lemmas.
[END THOUGHTS]

[ISOMORPHISM PLAN]
1. Start by analyzing the generated specification. The original specification doesn't reveal the implementation details, but you can see that the generated specification is a simple if-else statement that checks if `x` is less than 0.
2. Use this information to write a proof that shows that the two specifications are equivalent.
3. Try different cases for `x`, and show that the properties of the generated specification hold true for the original specification as well.

[END THOUGHTS]

[ISOMORPHISM PLAN]
1. Start by analyzing the generated specification. The main idea is to create a specific instance of the generated specification and show that it satisfies the properties of the problem specification and vice versa.
2. It is important to note that we should not use specific implementation details in the proof because the specification has to be proven for all implementations. So assuming a specific implementation is not a good idea.
3. Use `by_cases` to handle the case when x = y * y and when x ≠ y * y.
4. Then simplify `if-else` statements and use an instance of the problem specification to show that the two specifications are equivalent. You might also have to show that y * y = y ^ 2, this can be done using `ring`.
5. For the reverse direction, you can use similar reasoning.
6. Introduce the `h_specialized_spec` variable to represent the specialized version of the problem specification and show that it satisfies the generated specification.
