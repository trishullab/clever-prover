[INFORMAL-PROOF]
1. Start by analyzing the generated specification. The original specification doesn't reveal the implementation details, but you can see that the generated specification is a simple if-else statement that checks if `x` is less than 0.
2. Use this information to write a proof that shows that the two specifications are equivalent.
3. Try different cases for `x`, and show that the properties of the generated specification hold true for the original specification as well.
