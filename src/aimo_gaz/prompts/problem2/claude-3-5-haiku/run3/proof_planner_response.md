I'll outline a detailed plan for proving the correctness of the `truncate_number` function in Lean 4:

Proof Strategy Overview:
1. The implementation is quite straightforward - it subtracts the floor of the number from the original number. 

Key Proof Steps:
1. First, prove that the result is non-negative
   - This follows directly from the properties of Rat.floor, which always returns the largest integer less than or equal to the input number
   - Subtracting the floor will always yield a non-negative number less than 1

2. Prove that the result is less than 1
   - This is a direct consequence of the definition of floor
   - The subtraction of floor will always result in a fractional part less than 1

3. Prove the reconstruction property
   - Show that number = number.floor + (number - number.floor)
   - This is essentially an algebraic manipulation that is trivially true

Detailed Proof Plan:
```lean
theorem correctness
(number: Rat)
: problem_spec implementation number := by
  -- Unfold the problem specification
  unfold problem_spec
  
  -- Set the result to the implementation
  let result := implementation number
  
  -- Prove the three parts of the specification
  
  -- Part 1: Result is non-negative
  have h1 : 0 â‰¤ result := by
    -- Proof follows from floor property
    simp [implementation]
    apply sub_nonneg.mpr
    apply le_floor

  -- Part 2: Result is less than 1  
  have h2 : result < 1 := by
    -- Proof follows from floor property
    simp [implementation]
    apply floor_lt

  -- Part 3: Reconstruction property
  have h3 : number = number.floor + result := by
    -- Algebraic manipulation
    simp [implementation]
    rfl

  -- Combine the three parts
  exists result
  apply And.intro h1
  apply And.intro h2 h3
```

Key Proof Techniques:
1. Use of `simp` to simplify algebraic expressions
2. Leverage built-in properties of Rat.floor
3. Prove each part of the specification separately
4. Use `exists` to show the implementation produces a result
5. Use `And.intro` to combine multiple proof obligations

The proof relies on fundamental properties of rational numbers and floor function, making it relatively straightforward. The main challenge is precisely capturing the three required properties of the truncation operation.

Potential Challenges:
- Ensuring the proof works for all rational numbers
- Handling edge cases like negative numbers or zero
- Proving the properties rigorously without relying on intuition

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of the proof strategy?
