For this problem, the proof strategy will be relatively straightforward since the implementation almost exactly matches the problem specification. Here's a detailed plan for proving the correctness:

1. Proof Strategy Overview:
   - The goal is to prove that the implementation `implementation` satisfies the problem specification `problem_spec`
   - The specification requires two main things:
     a) The function returns the decimal part of the number
     b) The function terminates

2. Proof Structure:
   - First, demonstrate that the function always terminates
     - This is trivial because the function performs a simple subtraction operation
     - Use `exists` to show there's always a result

   - Then, verify that the result matches the specification
     - Prove that `number - number.floor` correctly extracts the decimal part
     - This follows directly from the definition of `floor` in Lean's rational number library

3. Detailed Proof Steps:
   - Start by unfolding the `problem_spec`
   - Split the proof into two main parts:
     a) Termination: Show `âˆƒ result, implementation number = result`
     b) Specification: Show `result = number - number.floor`

4. Key Proof Techniques:
   - Use basic algebraic reasoning
   - Leverage built-in properties of `Rat.floor`
   - Use simple rewrite and reflexivity tactics

Here's a potential proof outline in Lean 4:

```lean
theorem correctness
(number: Rat)
: problem_spec implementation number := by
  -- Unfold problem specification
  unfold problem_spec
  
  -- Prove termination
  apply Exists.intro (implementation number)
  
  -- Prove specification
  unfold implementation
  unfold spec
  
  -- This should be true by definition
  rfl
```

The proof is remarkably simple because:
1. The implementation exactly matches the specification
2. Lean's rational number library provides the necessary `floor` functionality
3. The decimal part extraction is a direct subtraction operation

The key insight is that `number - number.floor` precisely removes the integer part, leaving only the decimal portion less than 1.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this proof strategy?
