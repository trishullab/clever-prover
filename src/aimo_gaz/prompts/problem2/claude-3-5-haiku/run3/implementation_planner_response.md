Here's a detailed plan for implementing the `truncate_number` function in Lean 4:

1. Understand the Problem:
   - The function takes a positive rational number as input
   - It should return the decimal part of the number (the part less than 1)
   - This is essentially the difference between the original number and its floor (largest integer part)

2. Implementation Strategy:
   - Use the built-in `Rat.floor` method to get the integer part
   - Subtract the floor value from the original number to get the decimal part

3. Detailed Implementation Steps:
   - Take the input rational number
   - Calculate its floor value using `number.floor`
   - Subtract the floor value from the original number
   - This will naturally give the decimal part (always less than 1)

4. Lean 4 Specific Considerations:
   - Use `Rat` type for rational numbers
   - Leverage existing methods like `floor` for precise calculation
   - Ensure the result is always between 0 and 1

5. Potential Implementation Approach:
```lean
def implementation (number: Rat) : Rat :=
  number - number.floor
```

6. Key Points to Verify:
   - Handles positive rational numbers
   - Returns the decimal part
   - Works with whole numbers (will return 0)
   - Handles fractional numbers correctly

The implementation is straightforward due to Lean 4's built-in rational number operations. The subtraction of the floor value from the original number directly yields the decimal part.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this implementation plan?
