Here are the conjectured lemmas for the problem of truncating a number, written in Lean 4:

```lean
lemma truncate_number_termination
(number: Rat)
: ∃ result, implementation number = result := by
sorry

lemma truncate_number_decimal_part_property
(number: Rat)
: 0 ≤ implementation number ∧ implementation number < 1 := by
sorry

lemma truncate_number_subtraction_identity
(number: Rat)
: number = number.floor + implementation number := by
sorry

lemma truncate_number_uniqueness
(number: Rat)
(a b: Rat)
(h1: 0 ≤ a ∧ a < 1)
(h2: 0 ≤ b ∧ b < 1)
(h3: number.floor + a = number.floor + b)
: a = b := by
sorry

lemma truncate_number_well_defined
(number: Rat)
: ∀ x, 0 ≤ x ∧ x < 1 → 
       x = implementation number → 
       x = number - number.floor := by
sorry
```

These lemmas provide a structured approach to reasoning about the number truncation function, covering:
1. Termination of the function
2. Properties of the decimal part
3. Relationship between original number, floor, and truncated part
4. Uniqueness of the truncated decimal part
5. Well-definedness of the truncation operation
