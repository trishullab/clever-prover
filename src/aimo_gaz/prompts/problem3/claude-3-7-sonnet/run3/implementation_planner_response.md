# Implementation Plan for Below Zero Function

To implement the `below_zero` function, I'll track the account balance while processing each operation and check if it ever falls below zero. Here's my detailed plan:

1. Create a recursive helper function that will maintain a running balance while traversing the list of operations.

2. The helper function will take two parameters:
   - The remaining list of operations to process
   - The current balance of the account

3. For the base case of the recursion:
   - If the list of operations is empty, return `false` since we've processed all operations without the balance going below zero.

4. For the recursive case:
   - Extract the first operation (head) and the remaining operations (tail)
   - Calculate the new balance by adding the current operation to the existing balance
   - Check if the new balance is negative (below zero)
     - If yes, immediately return `true` since we found a case where the balance falls below zero
     - If no, recursively call the helper function with the remaining operations and the updated balance

5. In the main implementation function, call the helper function with:
   - The complete list of operations as input
   - An initial balance of 0 (as specified in the problem)

This approach efficiently processes the list of operations in a single pass while maintaining the running balance. The function will terminate early as soon as a negative balance is detected, or return `false` after processing all operations if the balance never falls below zero.

The recursive approach aligns well with Lean's functional programming style and makes the logic straightforward to follow.
