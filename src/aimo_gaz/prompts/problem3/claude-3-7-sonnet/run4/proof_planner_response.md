[LEMMA PLAN]
I need to prove a lemma that relates the `process` function's behavior to the problem spec's definition of `below_zero_condition`. This lemma will establish that the process function returns true if and only if there exists a prefix of the operations list (possibly including the initial balance) that sums to a negative value.

The lemma will show the equivalence between the recursive processing and the existential condition in the problem spec. I'll use induction on the structure of the operations list to prove this.
[LEMMA]
lemma process_below_zero_equiv
(ops: List Int)
(balance: Int)
: implementation.process ops balance = true ↔
  ∃ i, i ≤ ops.length ∧ (balance + (ops.take i).sum < 0) := by
sorry
[END]

[CORRECTNESS PLAN]
To prove the correctness theorem, I'll follow these steps:

1. Unfold the definition of `problem_spec` to understand what we need to prove.
2. Apply the function implementation to the operations list and assign the result to a variable.
3. Expand the definition of `implementation` to reveal the call to `process` with initial balance 0.
4. Use the `process_below_zero_equiv` lemma with `balance = 0` to establish the relationship between the function result and the existence of a prefix with negative sum.
5. Break into cases based on whether the result is true or false:
   - If the result is true, use the lemma to show that `below_zero_condition` holds.
   - If the result is false, use the lemma to show that `¬below_zero_condition` holds.
6. Both cases directly establish that the spec is satisfied, completing the proof.

The key insight is that `process ops balance` returns true exactly when there exists some prefix of ops that, when added to the balance, yields a negative value. When we start with balance=0, this aligns perfectly with the problem specification's `below_zero_condition`.
