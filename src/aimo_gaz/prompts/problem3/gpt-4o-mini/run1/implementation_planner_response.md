To implement the `below_zero` function in Lean 4, we will follow a systematic approach. Below are the detailed steps we will take:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem 
The problem requires us to track the balance of a bank account starting at zero. We need to process a list of integers, where positive integers represent deposits and negative integers represent withdrawals. Our goal is to return `true` if at any time the balance goes below zero, otherwise return `false`.

### Step 2: Analyze the Problem Specification
The specification provides a formal condition that needs to be satisfied:
- The function must check if there exists an index `i` such that the sum of the first `i` operations falls below zero.
- If the result of the function is `true`, then the program must detect a point where the balance becomes negative. If `false`, it must confirm that the balance has never been negative throughout all operations. 

### Step 3: Define the Function Implementation
The implementation will involve a few key steps:
1. **Initialize Balance**: Start with an initial balance of 0.
2. **Iterate Through Operations**: Loop through the list of operations while updating the balance.
3. **Check for Below Zero**: After each update to the balance, check if it has fallen below zero.
4. **Return Result**: If the balance ever goes below zero, return `true`. If the loop completes without the balance going below zero, return `false`.

### Step 4: Write the Implementation in Lean 4
We will implement the above logic in Lean 4. The overall structure of the function will look as follows:

```lean
def below_zero(operations: List Int) : Bool :=
  let balance := operations.foldl (Î» acc op => 
    let newBalance := acc + op
    if newBalance < 0 then 
      return true  -- Balance goes below zero
    else 
      newBalance
  ) 0  ;  -- Starting balance is 0
  false  -- If we exit the loop without hitting the condition, return false
```

### Step 5: Write the Loop Logic
Given that Lean 4 does not allow for straightforward imperative constructs (like looping with mutations), we will instead use a recursive approach or a functional style of folding through the list.

### Step 6: Test Cases
Next, we will ensure our implementation works correctly by using the provided test cases:
1. **Test with No Withdrawals**: Check that the input `[1, 2, 3]` gives an output of `false`.
2. **Test with Withdrawal Leading to Negative Balance**: Check that the input `[1, 2, -4, 5]` gives an output of `true`.

### Step 7: Edge Cases
Consider additional test cases to ensure robustness:
1. An empty list should return `false` since there are no operations to cause a negative balance.
2. A list with only withdrawals that sum to exactly zero should return `false`.
3. A list with immediate withdrawals resulting in a negative balance.

### Step 8: Finalize the Code
After implementing the function and testing it with various cases, we will ensure that the code is clean, well-documented, and adheres to Lean 4's syntax and paradigms.

By following these steps in a structured manner, we can effectively implement the `below_zero` function in Lean 4.
