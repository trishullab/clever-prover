Here's a detailed plan to implement the `below_zero` function in Lean 4:

1. Problem Understanding
- We need to track the running balance of a bank account
- As we process through the list of operations (deposits/withdrawals)
- We want to detect if the balance ever goes below zero
- Return true as soon as balance becomes negative
- Return false if balance never goes negative

2. Implementation Strategy
- Use a recursive or fold-based approach
- Track the current running balance
- Check balance after each operation
- If balance goes negative, immediately return true
- If list is exhausted without going negative, return false

3. Recursive Implementation Plan
- Base case: empty list returns false
- Recursive case:
  * Calculate running balance
  * Check if balance is negative
  * If negative, return true
  * If not, continue processing remaining list

4. Detailed Implementation Steps
```lean
def belowZero (operations: List Int) : Bool :=
  let go (balance: Int) : List Int â†’ Bool
    | [] => false
    | x :: xs => 
        let newBalance := balance + x
        if newBalance < 0 then true
        else go newBalance xs
  go 0 operations
```

5. Implementation Rationale
- Start with zero balance
- Recursive helper function `go`
- Tracks running balance
- Checks balance after each operation
- Returns true on first negative balance
- Returns false if list fully processed

6. Verification Considerations
- Function terminates because list is finite
- Always returns a boolean
- Matches problem specification

7. Test Case Coverage
- Positive deposits (will not go negative)
- Mixed deposits and withdrawals
- Early negative balance scenario
- Full list traversal scenario

This implementation provides a clean, functional approach to solving the below-zero detection problem in Lean 4.

Would you like me to elaborate on any part of this implementation plan?
