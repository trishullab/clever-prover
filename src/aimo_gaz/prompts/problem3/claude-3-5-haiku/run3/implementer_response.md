Here's the implementation in Lean 4:

```lean
def implementation (operations: List Int) : Bool :=
  let rec loop (balance: Int) : List Int â†’ Bool
    | [] => false
    | x :: xs =>
      let newBalance := balance + x
      if newBalance < 0 then 
        true 
      else 
        loop newBalance xs
  
  loop 0 operations
```

Let's break down the implementation:

1. We define a local recursive helper function `loop` that takes the current `balance` and the remaining `operations` list.

2. The base case is an empty list, which returns `false` (no negative balance found).

3. In the recursive case:
   - Calculate the new balance by adding the head of the list to the current balance
   - If the new balance goes negative, immediately return `true`
   - Otherwise, recursively call `loop` with the new balance and the tail of the list

4. The main `implementation` function starts the recursion with an initial balance of 0 and the full list of operations.

This solution follows the plan outlined:
- It uses a recursive approach
- Tracks the running balance
- Returns true immediately if balance becomes negative
- Returns false if the entire list is traversed without going below zero

The implementation handles the test cases:
- `[1, 2, 3]` returns `false` (balance never goes negative)
- `[1, 2, -4, 5]` returns `true` (balance goes negative at some point)

The function is concise, efficient, and matches the problem specification.
