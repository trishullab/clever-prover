Here's a Lean 4 proof for the correctness of the `below_zero` function:

```lean
theorem correctness
(operations: List Int)
: problem_spec implementation operations
:= by
  -- Unfold the problem specification
  unfold problem_spec

  -- Use the implementation_specification_connection lemma
  have h_spec_conn := implementation_specification_connection operations

  -- Strategically choose the result of the implementation
  let result := implementation operations
  use result

  -- Introduce rounds played condition (trivially true for this problem)
  intro _

  -- Break down the proof into two cases based on result
  cases h_result : result
  
  -- Case 1: result is false (no negative balance found)
  · have h_not_below_zero : ¬(∃ i, i ≤ operations.length ∧ (operations.take i).sum < 0) := by
      rw [← h_spec_conn]
      simp [h_result]
    
    -- Prove the specification for the false case
    apply h_not_below_zero

  -- Case 2: result is true (negative balance detected)
  · have h_below_zero : ∃ i, i ≤ operations.length ∧ (operations.take i).sum < 0 := by
      rw [← h_spec_conn]
      simp [h_result]
    
    -- Prove the specification for the true case
    exact h_below_zero
```

This proof leverages the `implementation_specification_connection` lemma to directly relate the implementation's result to the problem specification. It handles both cases (returning `true` and `false`) by showing the existence (or non-existence) of a prefix sum that goes negative.

The key steps are:
1. Unfold the problem specification
2. Use the connection lemma to relate implementation to specification
3. Case analysis on the result of the implementation
4. For each case, show that the result matches the specification condition

The proof is concise and relies on the pre-established lemma that connects the implementation's logic to the specification requirements.
