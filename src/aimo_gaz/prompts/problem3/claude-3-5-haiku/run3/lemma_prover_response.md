Here's a Lean 4 proof for the lemma:

```lean
lemma loop_balance_tracking
(operations: List Int)
(initial_balance: Int)
: ∀ (xs: List Int) (current_balance: Int), 
  current_balance = initial_balance + (operations.take (operations.length - xs.length)).sum →
  (implementation.loop initial_balance operations = true) = 
  (implementation.loop initial_balance xs = true) := by
  -- Use structural induction on xs
  induction' xs generalizing initial_balance
  
  -- Base case: empty list
  · intro current_balance h_balance
    simp [implementation.loop]
    
  -- Inductive case: cons
  · rename_i head tail ih
    intro current_balance h_balance
    
    -- Expand the recursive definition of loop
    simp [implementation.loop]
    
    -- Consider the new balance after the head operation
    set new_balance := current_balance + head
    
    -- Branch based on whether the new balance goes negative 
    by_cases h_negative: new_balance < 0
    
    -- Case 1: New balance is negative, loop terminates true
    · simp [h_negative]
      rfl
    
    -- Case 2: New balance is non-negative, continue recursion 
    · simp [h_negative]
      
      -- Prepare an updated balance tracking for the recursive call
      have h_next_balance : new_balance = 
        initial_balance + (operations.take (operations.length - tail.length)).sum := by
        rw [← h_balance]
        congr 1
        simp
      
      -- Apply the inductive hypothesis
      specialize ih new_balance h_next_balance
      
      -- Finish proof using the inductive hypothesis
      exact ih
```

The proof proceeds by structural induction on the list of operations. Key steps include:

1. Base case for an empty list, which simply checks the loop termination condition
2. Inductive case handling the head of the list
3. Splitting cases on whether the balance becomes negative
4. Tracking the cumulative balance using prefix sum
5. Applying the inductive hypothesis to prove the balance tracking property

The lemma shows that the result of `implementation.loop` depends only on the sequence of operations encountered, not on how you slice the list, as long as you maintain the correct cumulative balance.
