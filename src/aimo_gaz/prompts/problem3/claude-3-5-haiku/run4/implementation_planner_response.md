Here's a detailed implementation plan for the `below_zero` function in Lean 4:

1. Strategy Overview:
   - Use a recursive approach to track the running balance
   - Continuously check if the cumulative sum goes below zero
   - Return true immediately if balance becomes negative
   - Return false if we complete traversing the list without going below zero

2. Implementation Steps:
   a. Define a recursive helper function `loop` that:
      - Takes the current list of operations
      - Maintains the running cumulative balance
      - Checks for negative balance at each step

   b. In the `loop` function, use pattern matching on the operations list:
      - Base case (empty list): return false (never went below zero)
      - Recursive case: 
        * Calculate new balance by adding head of list to current balance
        * If new balance is negative, return true
        * Otherwise, recursively call `loop` with tail of list

   c. The main function will simply call this recursive helper
      - Initial balance starts at 0
      - Pass entire list of operations to the helper

3. Recursive Helper Function Structure:
```lean
def loop (balance : Int) : List Int â†’ Bool
  | [] => false  -- No negative balance found
  | x :: xs => 
      let newBalance := balance + x
      if newBalance < 0 then 
        true  -- Balance went negative
      else 
        loop newBalance xs
```

4. Main Implementation:
```lean
def implementation (operations : List Int) : Bool :=
  loop 0 operations
```

5. Key Considerations:
   - Handle empty list case
   - Track cumulative balance
   - Detect first instance of negative balance
   - Short-circuit and return true on first negative balance
   - Return false if list is traversed completely without going negative

6. Type and Termination Reasoning:
   - Input is a list of integers
   - Output is a boolean
   - Recursive call reduces list size, ensuring termination
   - Each recursive step either returns or processes a smaller list

This approach provides a clean, functional solution that matches the problem specification, efficiently checks for negative balance, and handles the test cases provided.
