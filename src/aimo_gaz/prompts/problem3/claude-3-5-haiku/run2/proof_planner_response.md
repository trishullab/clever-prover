Here's a detailed plan for proving the correctness of the `below_zero` function in Lean 4:

1. Proof Strategy Overview:
   - We'll need to prove two key properties:
     a) The function terminates 
     b) The function's result correctly captures whether the balance goes below zero

2. Termination Proof:
   - This is straightforward because the recursive helper function:
     * Takes a decreasing list as input
     * Has a clear base case (empty list)
     * Processes each list element exactly once
   - We'll likely use structural induction on the input list

3. Correctness Proof Steps:
   a) First, understand the spec's conditions:
      - The function should return true if ANY prefix sum becomes negative
      - The function should return false if NO prefix sum becomes negative

   b) Key proof tactics I would employ:
      - Use induction on the operations list
      - Develop an invariant about the current sum
      - Show that the implementation matches the existential condition in the spec

4. Detailed Proof Sketch:
   - Start by introducing the operations list
   - Set up an inductive hypothesis about the recursive helper
   - Prove base cases (empty list)
   - Prove inductive step showing:
     * If current sum goes negative, return true
     * If not, continue processing remaining operations
   - Use tactics like `intro`, `induction`, `simp`, `have`

5. Specific Lean 4 Proof Techniques:
   - Use `match` to handle list cases
   - Leverage `List.take` and `List.sum` properties
   - Apply induction and case analysis
   - Use `exists` to demonstrate existential conditions

6. Potential Proof Challenges:
   - Precisely capturing the "first point below zero" condition
   - Ensuring the existential quantifier is correctly interpreted
   - Managing prefix sum calculations

The proof will essentially show that the recursive implementation exactly captures the spec's condition of finding the first point where cumulative balance becomes negative.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these proof strategy points?
