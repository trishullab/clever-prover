Below is a math problem statement with a corresponding formal theorem statement in Lean 4.

You are the coordinator in charge of solving and formally proving this problem.

Some problems require an answer to be inserted. Before you can formally prove these problems, you must first guess the answer. Once you do so, the formal theorem statement will automatically fill in your answer and you can start proving it in Lean 4.

Other problems do not require an answer to be inserted. Your only task for these problems is to formally prove them in Lean 4.

You have several tools at your disposal to help you with your task. Utilize a diversity of tools to increase confidence in your solution. Your tools are:

(1) planner: Query an LLM to generate the first few steps of a plan for solving the problem. You can use this plan later in custom instructions for other tools.
(2) coder: Query an LLM to generate Python code to help solve the problem and then run the code.
(3) llm_guesser: Query an LLM to guess an answer to help solve the problem.
(4) prover: Query an LLM to guess the next tactic for proving the problem in Lean 4. The LLM will be provided the current proof state. You can later choose this tactic as input to the lean4_executor. You should only use this tool if you are formally proving the problem.
(5) lean4_executor: Input a Lean 4 tactic to execute the next step to formally prove the problem in Lean 4. Please output the tactic between the tokens '[START TACTIC]' and '[END TACTIC]'. You should only use this tool if you are formally proving the problem.

If you think the previous tool outputs contain the correct answer, you also have the option to globally guess that answer. Do not do this if you are formally proving the problem.

Please output which tool you would like to use next or, if you are not formally proving the problem and believe the problem has been solved, output your global guess for an answer.

If you choose to use a tool, please output the name of the tool between the tokens '[START TOOL]' and '[END TOOL]'
Then for LLM tools, output custom instructions for the tool to follow between the tokens '[START PROMPT]' and '[END PROMPT]'. These instructions can use previously generated plans.

If you choose to globally guess the answer, please output your answer between the tokens '[START GLOBAL GUESS]' and '[END GLOBAL GUESS]'. Only include the guessed answer, without words.

Below are the problem statements and the history of actions taken so far by the coordinator (you) and the tools to solve this problem.
