To prove that the given function implementation satisfies the problem specification in Lean 4, we will follow these detailed steps:

1. **Understand the Problem Specification**: 
   - The problem specifies that we need to demonstrate that the implementation `number - number.floor` results in a value (`result`) such that it meets the specification of being the decimal part of the input `number`.

2. **Analyze the Function Implementation**:
   - The implementation calculates `number - number.floor`, which effectively subtracts the largest integer less than or equal to `number` from `number` itself. This subtraction leaves us with the decimal part of the number, as intended. 

3. **Define the Specification**:
   - The specification (`spec`) is defined as `res = number - number.floor`. This means that for any `res` that results from our implementation, `res` must equal the decimal remainder of `number`.

4. **Establish the Theorem**:
   - Our goal is to affirm that `problem_spec implementation number` is correct. This can be broken down as follows:
      - Show that the implementation produces a result.
      - Demonstrate that the result satisfies the specification outlined.

5. **Formalize the Proof Outline**:
   - We will use the theorem `correctness`, which states that for any positive rational number `number`, the implementation meets the specification.

6. **Constructing the Proof**:
   - **Step 1**: Assume an arbitrary positive rational `number`.
   - **Step 2**: Evaluate the implementation `implementation number`, which gives us `number - number.floor`.
   - **Step 3**: Let `result := implementation number`, implying `result = number - number.floor`.
   - **Step 4**: Show that `result` satisfies the specification.
     - We need to show that `result` fulfills the condition `spec result`, which is effectively `result = number - number.floor`.
     - Given how we defined `result`, this holds directly.

7. **Use Lean's Tactics**:
   - Implement the proof in Lean using appropriate tactics:
     - `have` to state intermediate results.
     - `exact` to unify the left and right sides of the equation.
     - Utilize `exists` to express the existence of some `result`.

8. **Conclude the Proof**:
   - Confirm all the steps lead back to the requirement of the specification, encapsulating our entire argument in the framework of Lean.

9. **Wrap Up with a Comment**:
   - Add a comment at the end of the theorem to clarify that the proof establishes that our implementation properly extracts the decimal part of a given positive floating point number as intended.

Now that we have established these steps, we can proceed to formalize the proof in Lean 4 using the provided framework. Each step will be carefully articulated within the Lean environment to validate the correctness of our implementation against the specifications required.
