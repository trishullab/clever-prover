[LEMMA PLAN]
Prove a `floor_properties` lemma that establishes the two key properties of the floor function: that for any rational number x, the floor of x is less than or equal to x, and x is strictly less than floor(x) + 1. This is the mathematical foundation for our correctness proof.

[CORRECTNESS PLAN]
To prove the correctness theorem, I'll follow these steps:

1. Unfold the `problem_spec` definition to reveal what we need to prove.
2. Let `result := implementation number` to explicitly define the output.
3. Show that `∃ result, implementation number = result` by using the definition.
4. For the specification correctness, prove three parts:
   a. First prove `0 ≤ result`:
      - Use the first part of the `floor_properties` lemma to show that `number.floor ≤ number`
      - Therefore `0 ≤ number - number.floor = result`
   
   b. Then prove `result < 1`:
      - Use the second part of the `floor_properties` lemma to show that `number < number.floor + 1`
      - Therefore `number - number.floor < 1`, which means `result < 1`
   
   c. Finally prove `number = number.floor + result`:
      - Substitute the definition of `result = number - number.floor`
      - Use basic algebra to show that `number.floor + (number - number.floor) = number`

This approach directly uses the algebraic properties of floor and subtraction to establish that our implementation correctly returns the fractional part of a number.
