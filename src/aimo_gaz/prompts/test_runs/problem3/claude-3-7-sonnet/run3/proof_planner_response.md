# Plan for Proving the Correctness of below_zero Function

To prove that the `implementation` function correctly satisfies the `problem_spec`, I would take the following steps:

## 1. Define and Prove Helper Lemmas About the Recursive Process Function

First, I'll need to create lemmas that establish the relationship between the recursive `process` function and the prefix sums described in the specification.

### Lemma: process_characterization

I would define a lemma that characterizes what `process ops balance` means in terms of prefix sums:

```
lemma process_characterization (ops: List Int) (balance: Int):
  process ops balance = true ↔ 
    ∃ i, i ≤ ops.length ∧ balance + (ops.take i).sum < 0
```

This lemma states that `process` returns true if and only if there exists a position in the list where the balance becomes negative.

#### Proof approach for process_characterization:
- Use induction on the structure of `ops`
- Base case: When `ops = []`, show that both sides are false
- Inductive case: For `ops = op :: rest`:
  - Case 1: If `balance + op < 0`, show that the left side is true and the right side is true (with i=1)
  - Case 2: If `balance + op ≥ 0`, use the induction hypothesis with `rest` and `balance + op`

## 2. Relate the Implementation to the Specification

### Lemma: implementation_spec_equivalence

```
lemma implementation_spec_equivalence (operations: List Int):
  implementation operations = true ↔ 
    ∃ i, i ≤ operations.length ∧ (operations.take i).sum < 0
```

This lemma directly connects the implementation to the specification's condition.

#### Proof approach:
- Unfold the definition of `implementation`
- Apply the `process_characterization` lemma with `balance = 0`
- Use algebraic manipulation to show this is equivalent to the specification's condition

## 3. Prove the Main Correctness Theorem

With the helper lemmas in place, I would prove the main correctness theorem:

```
theorem correctness (operations: List Int):
  problem_spec implementation operations := by
```

#### Proof approach:
1. Unfold the definition of `problem_spec`
2. Let `result := implementation operations`
3. Show `∃ result, implementation operations = result` (trivial since the function always returns a boolean)
4. For the main proof, split into cases based on whether `result` is true or false:
   - Case `result = true`:
     - Apply `implementation_spec_equivalence` to show that `below_zero_condition` holds
     - Therefore `spec result` holds by definition when `result = true`
   - Case `result = false`:
     - Apply `implementation_spec_equivalence` to show that `¬below_zero_condition` holds
     - Therefore `spec result` holds by definition when `result = false`
5. Conclude that `problem_spec implementation operations` holds

## 4. Additional Helper Lemmas That May Be Needed

I might need additional helper lemmas about list operations:

```
lemma take_cons (x: Int) (xs: List Int) (i: Nat):
  i > 0 → ((x :: xs).take i).sum = x + (xs.take (i-1)).sum
```

```
lemma take_length (xs: List Int):
  (xs.take xs.length).sum = xs.sum
```

These would help in manipulating the expressions involving `take` and `sum` that appear in the main proof.

The overall strategy is to establish a direct connection between the recursive implementation and the mathematical specification, then use this connection to prove that the implementation satisfies the required properties.
