This proof demonstrates the relationship between the cumulative sum of a prefix of operations and the loop's termination condition:

1. At each iteration, we track how the balance changes
2. We show that the result of `implementation.loop` is equivalent to checking if the cumulative sum goes negative
3. We use induction to prove this for prefixes of different lengths
4. The proof handles cases based on whether the current or previous balance goes negative
5. Key steps include careful tracking of list take and sum operations

The primary theorem relates the loop's behavior directly to the running sum of operations, showing exactly when and how the program would terminate.
