I'll outline a detailed plan for proving the correctness of the `below_zero` function in Lean 4. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Understand the Problem and Spec
- The function checks if a running balance ever goes below zero during a sequence of deposit/withdrawal operations
- The spec requires returning true if there's a point where the running sum becomes negative
- The implementation uses a recursive helper function that tracks the running balance

2. Proof Strategy
The proof will likely involve:
a) Showing the function always terminates
b) Proving the implementation matches the specification
c) Using structural induction on the input list

3. Key Proof Techniques
- Induction on the list of operations
- Case analysis on the first operation
- Tracking running balance and its properties
- Dealing with the recursive structure of the implementation

4. Detailed Proof Plan
- Start by introducing the input list of operations
- Perform induction on the list structure
- Base case (empty list):
  * Show balance remains zero
  * Prove no negative point exists
- Inductive step:
  * Consider first operation and its impact on balance
  * Recursively analyze remaining operations
  * Prove either:
    - Balance never goes negative
    - First point of negative balance is found

5. Proof Skeleton Outline
- Use structural induction
- Handle base case of empty list
- For non-empty list, consider two scenarios:
  1. First operation doesn't cause negative balance
  2. First operation causes negative balance
- Use recursion and induction hypothesis to prove correctness

6. Lean 4 Proof Tactics to Use
- `induction` for list structural induction
- `simp` for simplifying expressions
- `have` for introducing intermediate assertions
- `apply` for applying existing lemmas
- `cases` for case analysis

7. Potential Challenges
- Proving the existential condition in the specification
- Showing equivalence between recursive implementation and spec
- Handling different list lengths and operation sequences

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific part of this proof strategy?
