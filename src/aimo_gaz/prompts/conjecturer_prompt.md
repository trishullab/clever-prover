The instructions below describe a coding problem statement with a corresponding Lean 4 problem spec, function implementation, and correctness definition.

Along with these is a detailed plan with steps of how to prove the correctness definition in Lean 4 stating that the given function implementation follows the required problem spec.

Please write for me a list of conjectured lemmas in Lean 4 that will be useful for carrying out this proof. Fill in the proofs of these lemmas with `sorry`; do NOT write the tactics to prove these lemmas.

Please respond entirely in Lean 4.
