0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:

1. **Find the Intersection Points:** Set the equation of the parabola equal to the equation of the line to find the x-coordinates where the intersection occurs:
   \[
   kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.
   \]
   Rearrange this to form a quadratic equation:
   \[
   kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.
   \]

2. **Use the Distance Condition:** Let the roots of this quadratic equation be \(x_1\) and \(x_2\). According to the problem, the distance between these points is 6. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   |x_2 - x_1| = 6.
   \]

These steps provide a starting point by setting up the system of equations that will allow you to solve for the intersection points and incorporate the distance condition. Further steps would involve using properties of quadratic equations to solve for \(x_1\) and \(x_2\), and then calculating the required sum of the squares of distances to the origin.

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:

1. Determine the x-coordinates of the points of intersection \( A \) and \( B \) by setting the equation of the parabola equal to the equation of the line:
   \[
   kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4
   \]
   Rearrange this into a standard quadratic equation:
   \[
   kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0
   \]

2. Use the quadratic formula to find the x-coordinates of points \( A \) and \( B \). For a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), the solutions are given by:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   Here, \( a = k \), \( b = -2k \), and \( c = l - 4 \). Substituting these values into the formula gives:
   \[
   x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{(2k)^2 - 4 \cdot k \cdot (l-4)}}{2k}
   \]
   Simplify the expression:
   \[
   x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4k(l-4)}}{2k}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{2k \pm \sqrt{4k^2 - 4kl + 16k}}{2k}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{2k \pm 2\sqrt{k^2 - kl + 4k}}{2k}
   \]
   \[
   x = 1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{k^2 - kl + 4k}}{k}

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:

1. **Set up the intersection condition:** Since the parabola \( y = kx^2 - 2kx + l \) intersects the line \( y = 4 \) at points \( A \) and \( B \), equate the two expressions for \( y \):
   \[
   kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4

   Rearrange this equation to form a quadratic equation:
   \[
   kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0

2. **Find the roots of the quadratic equation:** Let \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) be the roots of the quadratic equation, representing the \( x \)-coordinates of points \( A \) and \( B \). According to the problem, the distance between \( A \) and \( B \) along the x-axis is 6, thus:

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:

1. **Find the Intersection Points:**  
   Set the equations of the parabola and the line equal to each other to find the x-coordinates of the intersection points:
   \[
   kx^2 - 2kx + l = 4.
   \]
   Rearrange this to form a quadratic equation:
   \[
   kx^2 - 2kx + (l - 4) = 0.
   \]

2. **Use the Distance Between Points:**  
   Let the roots of this quadratic equation be \(x_1\) and \(x_2\). Since the points \(A\) and \(B\) are 6 units apart on the x-axis, we have:
   \[
   |x_2 - x_1| = 6.
   \] 
   Use the properties of quadratic equations, where the distance between roots \(|x_2 - x_1|\) is given by:
   \[
   \sqrt{(-2k)^2 - 4k(l - 4)} = 6.
   \]

These initial steps will help in setting up the problem to find the values of \(x_1\) and \(x_2\), which will be used to find the y-coordinates and eventually solve for the desired distances.

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:

1. Understand the problem constraints: The numbers range from 111 to 999, and we need to color them either blue or yellow such that the sum of any two yellow numbers results in a blue number. This means if \(a\) and \(b\) are yellow numbers, then \(a + b\) must be a blue number.

2. Determine possible values: Calculate the possible sums of two yellow numbers. The minimum sum of two numbers in the range (111 + 111 = 222) and the maximum sum (999 + 999 = 1998) must be considered. However, since the sum must also be a three-digit blue number, the relevant range is from 222 to 999.

3. Identify constraints on yellow numbers: Identify the constraints these sums place on the yellow numbers. For instance, if a number is yellow, determine how its sum with itself or with other numbers can be a valid three-digit blue number.

4. Strategy for maximizing yellow numbers: Consider the strategy to maximize the count of yellow numbers. This will likely involve finding the largest possible set of numbers such that all pairwise sums fall within the available blue numbers range.

These steps set up the framework needed to approach finding the maximum number of yellow numbers while adhering to the problem's condition.

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:

1. **Understand the Sparkle Operation**: The sparkle operation involves two main steps:
   - Calculate the sum of the digits of a positive integer \( n \).
   - Take the factorial of that sum. 
   For example, for \( n = 13 \), the sum of the digits is \( 1 + 3 = 4 \), and the factorial of 4 is \( 4! = 24 \).

2. **Identify the Limiting Behavior**: Investigate the conditions under which the sequence of numbers resulting from repeated sparkle operations eventually consists only of numbers less than 6. Note that:
   - If the sum of digits is less than or equal to 3, its factorial is 6 or less.
   - If the sum of digits is 4, 5, or 6, the factorial is 24, 120, or 720, respectively, so we need to check further iterations to see if these values lead to sums of digits that are less than or equal to 3 eventually.

3. **Explore Numbers with Small Sums of Digits**: Begin by considering numbers whose digits sum to values that produce factorials of 6 or less directly. For example, numbers with digit sums of 1, 2, or 3 (since \( 1! = 1 \), \( 2! = 2 \), \( 3! = 6 \)).

4. **Iterate and Check for Convergence**: For numbers with larger digit sums, analyze if and how the sequence converges to a cycle where all numbers are less than 6. This involves calculating the sparkle operation repeatedly and observing the behavior of the sequence.

5. **Generalize for Up to 36 Digits**: Extend the analysis to numbers with up to 36 digits. A large number can have a digit sum anywhere between 1 and \( 9 \times 36 = 324 \). Investigate which sums lead to eventual stabilization under 6 after applying the sparkle operation repeatedly.

I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:\n\n1. **Understand the Sparkle Operation**: The sparkle operation involves two main steps:\n   - Calculate the sum of the digits of a positive integer \\( n \\).\n   - Take the factorial of that sum. \n   For example, for \\( n = 13 \\), the sum of the digits is \\( 1 + 3 = 4 \\), and the factorial of 4 is \\( 4! = 24 \\).\n\n2. **Identify the Limiting Behavior**: Investigate the conditions under which the sequence of numbers resulting from repeated sparkle operations eventually consists only of numbers less than 6. Note that:\n   - If the sum of digits is less than or equal to 3, its factorial is 6 or less.\n   - If the sum of digits is 4, 5, or 6, the factorial is 24, 120, or 720, respectively, so we need to check further iterations to see if these values lead to sums of digits that are less than or equal to 3 eventually.\n\n3. **Explore Numbers with Small Sums of Digits**: Begin by considering numbers whose digits sum to values that produce factorials of 6 or less directly. For example, numbers with digit sums of 1, 2, or 3 (since \\( 1! = 1 \\), \\( 2! = 2 \\), \\( 3! = 6 \\)).\n\n4. **Iterate and Check for Convergence**: For numbers with larger digit sums, analyze if and how the sequence converges to a cycle where all numbers are less than 6. This involves calculating the sparkle operation repeatedly and observing the behavior of the sequence.\n\n5. **Generalize for Up to 36 Digits**: Extend the analysis to numbers with up to 36 digits. A large number can have a digit sum anywhere between 1 and \\( 9 \\times 36 = 324 \\). Investigate which sums lead to eventual stabilization under 6 after applying the sparkle operation repeatedly.\n\nCan you write a python program that tries to solve the problem statement using SymPy? The code should always answer by printing only a number (integer or fraction) and nothing else. Make sure it runs correctly!\n\nStart the code with '```python' and end the code with '```'."}]

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:

1. Analyze the condition \( |x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \). Notice that \( |x-2y| = |-(y-2x)| = |y-2x| \), which simplifies the given condition to \( 2|x-2y| = 40 \). Thus, \( |x-2y| = 20 \).

2. Recognize that \( |x-2y| = 20 \) implies two cases:
   - Case 1: \( x-2y = 20 \)
   - Case 2: \( x-2y = -20 \)

3. For each case, express \( x \) in terms of \( y \), or vice versa, which will help in substituting into the expression \( 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \) to find the minimum value.

4. Substitute the expressions for \( x \) or \( y \) from the conditions into the quadratic function to reduce it to a single-variable quadratic function, and then find the minimum value using standard techniques for quadratics.

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:

1. Simplify the constraint: Analyze the expression \( |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40 \). Notice that this can be rewritten as \( |x - 2y| + |2x - y| = 40 \).

2. Explore possible cases for the absolute value expressions. The expression \( |x - 2y| + |2x - y| = 40 \) can be broken down into the following cases, depending on the relative values of \( x \) and \( y \):
   - Case 1: \( x - 2y \geq 0 \) and \( 2x - y \geq 0 \)
   - Case 2: \( x - 2y \geq 0 \) and \( 2x - y < 0 \)
   - Case 3: \( x - 2y < 0 \) and \( 2x - y \geq 0 \)
   - Case 4: \( x - 2y < 0 \) and \( 2x - y < 0 \)

3. For each case, solve the linear equations/inequalities to find expressions or relationships between \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy the constraint. This will help in determining the region over which the function \( 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \) needs to be minimized.

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:

1. Simplify the constraint: Start by analyzing the equation \( |x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \). Notice that \( |x-2y| = |2y-x| \), so the equation simplifies to \( 2|x-2y| = 40 \), which gives \( |x-2y| = 20 \).

2. Analyze the regions: The equation \( |x-2y| = 20 \) represents two lines: \( x-2y = 20 \) and \( x-2y = -20 \). This gives us two linear constraints, creating two regions in the \(xy\)-plane to analyze: \( x = 2y + 20 \) and \( x = 2y - 20 \).

3. Set up the objective function: The expression to minimize is \( 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \). Factor out the constant 5 to work with a simpler form: \( 5(x^2 + y^2 - \frac{8}{5}xy) \).

4. Use substitution: Substitute the expressions for \(x\) from the linear constraints into the simplified objective function to find the points of interest on each line.

2024-11-19 21:46:00,250 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [COORDINATOR] Output generated: Given the history, it seems the planner has already provided a structured approach to tackle the problem, especially by breaking it into cases based on the simplification of the constraint. Since previous attempts with the coder were unsuccessful, I will try using the `coder` tool again to solve the problem using the latest plan.

Let's use the coder to implement the plan and find the minimum value of the quadratic expression under the given constraint.

```python
from sympy import symbols, solve, Eq, Min

# Define variables
x, y = symbols('x y')

# Define the constraint equations based on the planner's breakdown
eq1 = Eq(x - 2*y, 20)
eq2 = Eq(x - 2*y, -20)

# Define the function to be minimized
f = 5*x**2 + 5*y**2 - 8*x*y

# Solve for y in terms of x using each constraint and substitute to find the minimum
# Case 1: x - 2y = 20
y1 = solve(eq1, y)[0]
f_sub1 = f.subs(y, y1)

# Case 2: x - 2y = -20
y2 = solve(eq2, y)[0]
f_sub2 = f.subs(y, y2)

# Minimize the function for each case
min_val1 = f_sub1.expand().simplify()
min_val2 = f_sub2.expand().simplify()

# Find the minimum values for the quadratic expression in each case
min_case1 = solve(min_val1.diff(x), x)
min_case2 = solve(min_val2.diff(x), x)

# Evaluate the function at these critical points
min_value_case1 = min(min_val1.subs(x, min_case1[0]), min_val1.subs(x, min_case1[1]))
min_value_case2 = min(min_val2.subs(x, min_case2[0]), min_val2.subs(x, min_case2[1]))

# The minimum value over both cases
min_value = min(min_value_case1, min_value_case2)

min_value
```

Let's run this code to find the minimum value.

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:

1. **Simplify the Condition:** Analyze the given condition \( |x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \). Notice that this can be rewritten as \( |x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40 \). Recognize that this equation essentially describes the geometric condition involving the absolute differences between linear combinations of \( x \) and \( y \).

2. **Consider Cases for Absolute Values:** Since absolute values result in piecewise linear expressions, consider different cases based on the signs of \( x-2y \) and \( y-2x \). This leads to several sub-cases to explore: 
   - Case 1: \( x-2y \geq 0 \) and \( y-2x \geq 0 \),
   - Case 2: \( x-2y \geq 0 \) and \( y-2x \leq 0 \),
   - Case 3: \( x-2y \leq 0 \) and \( y-2x \geq 0 \),
   - Case 4: \( x-2y \leq 0 \) and \( y-2x \leq 0 \).

3. **Analyze Each Case:** For each case, simplify the expression \( |x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40 \) to determine the constraints on \( x \) and \( y \). This will help in identifying the region or line segment in the \( xy \)-plane where \( x \) and \( y \) can lie.

4. **Express the Quadratic Form:** The objective is to minimize the expression \( 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \). Rewrite this expression in a more manageable form, possibly by completing the square or expressing it as a quadratic form. The expression can be rewritten as \( (Ax + By)^2 + C \), where you identify suitable coefficients \( A \), \( B \), and constant \( C \). This aids in understanding the geometry of the quadratic function.

I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:\n\n1. Analyze the condition \\( |x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \\). Notice that \\( |x-2y| = |-(y-2x)| = |y-2x| \\), which simplifies the given condition to \\( 2|x-2y| = 40 \\). Thus, \\( |x-2y| = 20 \\).\n\n2. Recognize that \\( |x-2y| = 20 \\) implies two cases:\n   - Case 1: \\( x-2y = 20 \\)\n   - Case 2: \\( x-2y = -20 \\)\n\n3. For each case, express \\( x \\) in terms of \\( y \\), or vice versa, which will help in substituting into the expression \\( 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \\) to find the minimum value.\n\n4. Substitute the expressions for \\( x \\) or \\( y \\) from the conditions into the quadratic function to reduce it to a single-variable quadratic function, and then find the minimum value using standard techniques for quadratics.\nEnd of loop 1.

Loops left: 8\n\nCoordinator chose tool: coder\nCode executor guessed: 400\nEnd of loop 3. Loops left: 7\n\nCoordinator chose tool: planner\nPlanner generated plan:\n0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:\n\n1. Simplify the constraint: Analyze the expression \\( |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40 \\). Notice that this can be rewritten as \\( |x - 2y| + |2x - y| = 40 \\).\n\n2. Explore possible cases for the absolute value expressions. The expression \\( |x - 2y| + |2x - y| = 40 \\) can be broken down into the following cases, depending on the relative values of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\):\n   - Case 1: \\( x - 2y \\geq 0 \\) and \\( 2x - y \\geq 0 \\)\n   - Case 2: \\( x - 2y \\geq 0 \\) and \\( 2x - y < 0 \\)\n   - Case 3: \\( x - 2y < 0 \\) and \\( 2x - y \\geq 0 \\)\n   - Case 4: \\( x - 2y < 0 \\) and \\( 2x - y < 0 \\)\n\n3. For each case, solve the linear equations/inequalities to find expressions or relationships between \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) that satisfy the constraint. This will help in determining the region over which the function \\( 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \\) needs to be minimized.\nEnd of loop 4.

Loops left: 5\n\nCoordinator chose tool: planner\nPlanner generated plan:\n0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:\n\n1. Simplify the condition: Start by simplifying the condition \\( |x - 2y| + |y - 2x| = 40 \\). Recognize that this simplifies to \\( |x - 2y| + |2y - x| = 40 \\), which is equivalent to \\( 2|x - 2y| = 40 \\), leading to \\( |x - 2y| = 20 \\).\n\n2. Analyze the cases for the absolute value condition: Since \\( |x - 2y| = 20 \\), consider two separate cases:\n   - Case 1: \\( x - 2y = 20 \\)\n   - Case 2: \\( x - 2y = -20 \\)\nEnd of loop 6. Loops left: 4\n\nCoordinator chose tool: planner\nPlanner generated plan:\n0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:\n\n1. Simplify the constraint: Start by analyzing the equation \\( |x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \\). Notice that \\( |x-2y| = |2y-x| \\), so the equation simplifies to \\( 2|x-2y| = 40 \\), which gives \\( |x-2y| = 20 \\).\n\n2. Analyze the regions: The equation \\( |x-2y| = 20 \\) represents two lines: \\( x-2y = 20 \\) and \\( x-2y = -20 \\). This gives us two linear constraints, creating two regions in the \\(xy\\)-plane to analyze: \\( x = 2y + 20 \\) and \\( x = 2y - 20 \\).\n\n3. Set up the objective function: The expression to minimize is \\( 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \\). Factor out the constant 5 to work with a simpler form: \\( 5(x^2 + y^2 - \\frac{8}{5}xy) \\).\n\n4. Use substitution: Substitute the expressions for \\(x\\) from the linear constraints into the simplified objective function to find the points of interest on each line.\nEnd of loop 7. Loops left: 3\n\nCoordinator chose tool: planner\nPlanner generated plan:\n0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:\n\n1. **Simplify the Condition:** Analyze the given condition \\( |x-2y| + |y-2x| = 40 \\). Notice that this can be rewritten as \\( |x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40 \\). Recognize that this equation essentially describes the geometric condition involving the absolute differences between linear combinations of \\( x \\) and \\( y \\).\n\n2. **Consider Cases for Absolute Values:** Since absolute values result in piecewise linear expressions, consider different cases based on the signs of \\( x-2y \\) and \\( y-2x \\). This leads to several sub-cases to explore: \n   - Case 1: \\( x-2y \\geq 0 \\) and \\( y-2x \\geq 0 \\),\n   - Case 2: \\( x-2y \\geq 0 \\) and \\( y-2x \\leq 0 \\),\n   - Case 3: \\( x-2y \\leq 0 \\) and \\( y-2x \\geq 0 \\),\n   - Case 4: \\( x-2y \\leq 0 \\) and \\( y-2x \\leq 0 \\).\n\n3. **Analyze Each Case:** For each case, simplify the expression \\( |x-2y| + |2x-y| = 40 \\) to determine the constraints on \\( x \\) and \\( y \\). This will help in identifying the region or line segment in the \\( xy \\)-plane where \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) can lie.\n\n4. **Express the Quadratic Form:** The objective is to minimize the expression \\( 5x^2 + 5y^2 - 8xy \\). Rewrite this expression in a more manageable form, possibly by completing the square or expressing it as a quadratic form. The expression can be rewritten as \\( (Ax + By)^2 + C \\), where you identify suitable coefficients \\( A \\), \\( B \\), and constant \\( C \\). This aids in understanding the geometry of the quadratic function.\nEnd of loop 8.

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:

1. Define the general form of a geometric sequence. A geometric sequence is a sequence where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio. Let's denote the first term as \(a\) and the common ratio as \(r\). Thus, the terms of the sequence can be expressed as \(a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ar^4\).

2. Set up constraints based on the problem statement. Since all terms must be 2-digit integers, we have the constraints: \(10 \leq a < 100\), \(10 \leq ar < 100\), \(10 \leq ar^2 < 100\), \(10 \leq ar^3 < 100\), and \(10 \leq ar^4 < 100\).

3. Identify \(r\) as a value that ensures all terms remain 2-digit integers. Since the sequence must be increasing, \(r\) must be greater than 1. Additionally, based on the 2-digit constraint, \(r\) must be such that multiplying by it doesn't result in a number exceeding 99 or falling below 10 for each subsequent term.

2. Analyze different cases for \(\vert x-1 \vert - 2\): To eliminate the absolute values, examine the expression \(\vert x-1 \vert - 2\) which can take different forms based on the value of \(\vert x-1 \vert\):

   - Case 1: \(\vert x-1 \vert \geq 2\), then \(\vert x-1 \vert - 2 \geq 0\) and \(\vert \vert x-1 \vert - 2 \vert = \vert x-1 \vert - 2\).

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:

1. Understand the structure of the equation: The given equation is \(\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}\). This involves nested absolute values, so it is important to consider the critical points where the expressions inside the absolute values change sign.

2. Identify the critical points for the absolute values: 
   - For \(\vert x-1 \vert\), the critical point is \(x = 1\).
   - For \(\vert \vert x-1 \vert - 2 \vert\), consider where \(\vert x-1 \vert - 2 = 0\), which gives the additional critical points \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

3. Divide the number line into intervals based on these critical points: The critical points are \(x = -1\), \(x = 1\), and \(x = 3\). This divides the number line into the intervals \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 1)\), \((1, 3)\), and \((3, \infty)\).

4. Analyze the behavior of the equation in each interval: Determine the expression for \(\vert \vert x-1 \vert - 2 \vert\) in each interval to understand how the solutions to the equation change as \(x\) moves across these intervals. This will involve removing the absolute value signs accordingly and solving for \(x\) in terms of \(m\).

These steps will help set up the conditions necessary to determine the values of \(m\) that allow for exactly four distinct solutions.

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:

1. Start by analyzing the structure of the equation \(\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}\). Recognize that it involves two layers of absolute values, suggesting that the problem can be simplified by considering different cases based on the values of \(x\).

2. Consider the expression \(\vert x - 1 \vert\), which can be split into two cases:
   - Case 1: \(x - 1 \geq 0\), which simplifies to \(x \geq 1\).
   - Case 2: \(x - 1 < 0\), which simplifies to \(x < 1\).

3. Analyze the inner case \(\vert x - 1 \vert = u\), where \(u = x - 1\) when \(x \geq 1\) and \(u = -(x - 1)\) when \(x < 1\). Then further consider the expression \(\vert u - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}\).

4. For \(\vert u - 2 \vert = \frac{m}{100}\), break it down into two cases:
   - Case 1: \(u - 2 = \frac{m}{100}\).
   - Case 2: \(u - 2 = -\frac{m}{100}\).

5. Solve for \(x\) in each sub-case derived from the steps above and determine the conditions under which there are 4 distinct solutions for \(x\).

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:

1. Analyze the expression \(\vert \vert x-1 \vert -2 \vert\). Consider the possible cases for the absolute value expressions to understand when the equation can have distinct solutions. Start by setting up the expression:

   - Case 1: \(x - 1 \geq 2\), so \(\vert x - 1 \vert = x - 1\) and \(\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = x - 3\). Thus, the expression becomes \(\vert x - 3 \vert = \frac{m}{100}\).

   - Case 2: \(0 \leq x - 1 < 2\), so \(\vert x - 1 \vert = x - 1\) and \(\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = 1 - x\). Thus, the expression becomes \(\vert 1 - x \vert = \frac{m}{100}\).

   - Case 3: \(x - 1 < 0\), so \(\vert x - 1 \vert = 1 - x\) and \(\vert x - 1 \vert - 2 = -x - 1\). Thus, the expression becomes \(\vert -x - 1 \vert = \frac{m}{100}\).

2. Solve each case separately to find the conditions under which each equation yields two distinct solutions. Determine the values of \(m\) for each case that contribute to a total of 4 distinct solutions for the original equation.

1. Identify the total number of possible outcomes when rolling four 6-sided dice. Since each die has 6 faces, the total number of outcomes is \(6^4\).

2. Determine the number of outcomes where the highest roll is exactly 5. This requires the highest value among the four dice rolls to be 5, meaning each die shows a number from 1 to 5, but at least one die must show a 5. 

3. Calculate the number of ways all four dice can show numbers from 1 to 5, which is \(5^4\).

The plan involves calculating the total number of possible outcomes, determining the number of favorable outcomes where the highest roll is exactly 5 using complementary counting, and then finding the probability. Let's proceed with coding this approach.

```python
# Total number of outcomes when rolling four 6-sided dice
total_outcomes = 6**4

# Number of outcomes where all four dice show numbers from 1 to 5
outcomes_1_to_5 = 5**4

# Number of outcomes where all four dice show numbers from 1 to 4
outcomes_1_to_4 = 4**4

# Number of outcomes where the highest number is 5, i.e., at least one die shows a 5
outcomes_highest_5 = outcomes_1_to_5 - outcomes_1_to_4

# Probability that the highest roll is 5
a, b = outcomes_highest_5, total_outcomes

from math import gcd

# Reduce the fraction a/b to its simplest form
gcd_ab = gcd(a, b)
a_simplified = a // gcd_ab
b_simplified = b // gcd_ab

a_simplified, b_simplified, a_simplified + b_simplified

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:

1. Calculate the total number of possible outcomes when rolling four 6-sided dice. Since each die has 6 faces, the total number of possible outcomes is \(6^4\).

2. Determine the number of favorable outcomes where the highest number rolled is 5. To do this, first calculate the number of outcomes where all dice show a number less than or equal to 5. Each die has 5 options (1 through 5), so there are \(5^4\) such outcomes.

3. From the outcomes calculated in step 2, subtract the outcomes where the highest number rolled is less than 5. This can be found by calculating the number of outcomes where all dice show numbers from 1 to 4, which is \(4^4\).

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:

1. Analyze the given equation: The equation is the product of two expressions being set to zero. This means that for the entire expression to equal zero, at least one of the two factors must be zero.

2. Solve each factor separately: 
   - Consider the first factor: \((|\vert x + y \vert - 10)^2 + (\vert x - y \vert - 10)^2 = 0\). 
     - Since both terms are squares, for their sum to be zero, each term must individually be zero. 
     - This gives us the system of equations: 
       \(|x + y| - 10 = 0\) and \(|x - y| - 10 = 0\).
     - Solve these equations to find the conditions on \(x\) and \(y\).

3. Solve the second factor:
   - Consider the second factor: \((|\vert x \vert - 8)^2 + (\vert y \vert - 8)^2 = 0\).
     - Similarly, each term must be zero for their sum to be zero.
     - This results in the system of equations:
       \(|x| - 8 = 0\) and \(|y| - 8 = 0\).
     - Solve these equations to determine further conditions on \(x\) and \(y\).

By solving these sets of equations, we will identify the specific points that contribute to the boundary of the convex polygon, which we can then use to determine its area.

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:

1. Assign coordinates to the vertices of the unit square \(ABCD\). Let \(A = (0, 0)\), \(B = (1, 0)\), \(C = (1, 1)\), and \(D = (0, 1)\).

2. Determine the coordinates of points \(P\) and \(Q\). Given that \(|AP| = \frac{1}{20}\), the point \(P\) on \(AB\) has coordinates \(P = \left(\frac{1}{20}, 0\right)\). Similarly, since \(|AQ| = \frac{1}{24}\), the point \(Q\) on \(AD\) has coordinates \(Q = \left(0, \frac{1}{24}\right)\).

3. Find the equations of lines \(DP\) and \(BQ\). 

   - Line \(DP\): Using points \(D = (0, 1)\) and \(P = \left(\frac{1}{20}, 0\right)\), find the slope \(m_{DP}\) and use the point-slope form to write the equation of the line.

   - Line \(BQ\): Using points \(B = (1, 0)\) and \(Q = \left(0, \frac{1}{24}\right)\), find the slope \(m_{BQ}\) and use the point-slope form to write the equation of the line.

These steps will allow us to find the intersection of lines \(DP\) and \(BQ\) and subsequently determine the areas of the four regions formed within the square.

1. Visualize and label the unit square \(ABCD\) with coordinates: \(A(0, 0)\), \(B(1, 0)\), \(C(1, 1)\), and \(D(0, 1)\).

2. Identify and label the points \(P\) and \(Q\):
   - Since \(P\) is on \(AB\) with \( |AP| = \frac{1}{20} \), the coordinates of \(P\) are \(\left( \frac{1}{20}, 0 \right)\).
   - Since \(Q\) is on \(AD\) with \( |AQ| = \frac{1}{24} \), the coordinates of \(Q\) are \(\left( 0, \frac{1}{24} \right)\).

3. Write the equations of the lines \(DP\) and \(BQ\):
   - The line \(DP\) passes through \(D(0, 1)\) and \(P\left(\frac{1}{20}, 0\right)\).
   - The line \(BQ\) passes through \(B(1, 0)\) and \(Q\left(0, \frac{1}{24}\right)\).

4. Calculate the intersection point of the lines \(DP\) and \(BQ\), which will help divide the square into four regions. 

By following these steps, we can further analyze the intersection and areas of the regions formed.

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:

1. Analyze the given conditions: We are given two conditions for the function \( f \):
   - \( f(f(f(n))) = 8n - 7 \)
   - \( f(2n) = 2f(n) + 1 \)
   These conditions must be satisfied for all positive integers \( n \).

2. Explore potential values for \( n \): Start with small values of \( n \) to build an understanding of how the function behaves. For example, try \( n = 1, 2, 3 \), etc., and use these values to find \( f(n) \), \( f(f(n)) \), and \( f(f(f(n))) \) to ensure the first condition is satisfied.

3. Simplify the second condition: The second condition can potentially help determine \( f(n) \) in a more straightforward way. Use specific values of \( n \) to find a pattern in \( f(n) \).

4. Hypothesize a form for \( f(n) \): Based on the patterns observed, hypothesize a general form for \( f(n) \). Verify that this hypothesized form satisfies both conditions for all \( n \) tested so far.

These steps will help lay the groundwork for solving the problem and calculating \( f(100) \).

            f_vals[n] = 8 * n - 7  # Adjust based on first condition

# Dictionary to store computed values of f(n)
f_vals = {}

explore_function(f_vals)

# Output the value for f(100)
f_vals.get(100, "Not computed")
```

I will now run the code to compute and see what value it determines for \( f(100) \).
