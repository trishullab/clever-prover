We need to solve the problem where the sum of two 5-digit numbers, represented as AMC10 and AMC12, equals 123422. Start by defining the two numbers in terms of their digits: 
- AMC10 can be expressed as 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10.
- AMC12 can be expressed as 10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12.
Next, create an equation that represents their sum:
(10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10) + (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12) = 123422.
Then, simplify this equation and solve for A, M, and C. Finally, find the sum A + M + C.

2025-01-27 00:10:26,711 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To evaluate \( 29^{13} - 5^{13} \mod 7 \), we first reduce \( 29 \) and \( 5 \) modulo \( 7 \):

\[
29 \mod 7 = 1 \quad (\text{since } 29 = 4 \times 7 + 1)
\]
\[
5 \mod 7 = 5
\]

Now, we can substitute these values into the expression:

\[
29^{13} \equiv 1^{13} \mod 7 \quad \text{and} \quad 5^{13} \equiv 5^{13} \mod 7
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
29^{13} - 5^{13} \equiv 1^{13} - 5^{13} \mod 7
\]
\[
\equiv 1 - 5^{13} \mod 7
\]

Next, we need to compute \( 5^{13} \mod 7 \). Using Fermat's Little Theorem, since \( 7 \) is prime and \( 5 \) is not divisible by \( 7 \):

\[
5^{6} \equiv 1 \mod 7
\]

Now, we can reduce \( 13 \) modulo \( 6 \):

\[
13 \mod 6 = 1
\]

Thus,

\[
5^{13} \equiv 5^{1} \equiv 5 \mod 7
\]

Now substituting back, we get:

\[
1 - 5^{13} \equiv 1 - 5 \mod 7
\]
\[
\equiv -4 \mod 7
\]
\[
\equiv 3 \mod 7 \quad (\text{since } -4 + 7 = 3)
\]

Therefore, we have shown that:

\[
29^{13} - 5^{13} \equiv 3 \mod 7
\]

Based on this calculation, the statement is true.

My guess for the numerical answer is:

2025-01-27 00:10:38,508 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To solve the problem, we first need to simplify \( 29^{13} \) and \( 5^{13} \) modulo \( 7 \).

Starting with \( 29 \mod 7 \):
\[
29 \div 7 = 4 \quad \text{(remainder 1)}
\]
Thus, \( 29 \equiv 1 \mod 7 \).

Now for \( 5^{13} \):
\[
5 \mod 7 = 5 \quad \text{(it remains 5)}
\]

Now substituting back into the expression:
\[
29^{13} - 5^{13} \equiv 1^{13} - 5^{13} \mod 7
\]
Calculating \( 1^{13} \):
\[
1^{13} \equiv 1 \mod 7
\]

Next, we need to calculate \( 5^{13} \mod 7 \). We can use Fermat's Little Theorem, which tells us that if \( p \) is a prime and \( a \) is not divisible by \( p \), then \( a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p \). Here, \( p = 7 \) and \( a = 5 \):
\[
5^{6} \equiv 1 \mod 7
\]
Therefore,
\[
5^{12} \equiv 1 \mod 7
\]
Thus,
\[
5^{13} \equiv 5^{12} \cdot 5 \equiv 1 \cdot 5 \equiv 5 \mod 7
\]

Putting it all together:
\[
29^{13} - 5^{13} \equiv 1 - 5 \mod 7
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
1 - 5 \equiv -4 \equiv 3 \mod 7
\]

Finally, we conclude:
\[
29^{13} - 5^{13} \equiv 3 \mod 7
\]

Thus, the statement is true.

   - Start with the expression \( (1 + x)^{n + 1} \) and rewrite it using the binomial theorem: 
     \[
     (1 + x)^{n + 1} = (1 + x)^n(1 + x).
     \]
   - Use the inductive hypothesis \( (1 + nx) \leq (1 + x)^n \) to relate \( (1 + nx) \) to \( (1 + x)^{n + 1} \).

4. **Direct Comparison**: Compare \( 1 + (n + 1)x \) with \( (1 + x)^{n + 1} \) to establish the inequality:
   - Show that \( (1 + nx) + x \leq (1 + x)^n(1 + x) \) holds under the assumption \( x > -1 \).

5. **Conclusion**: Conclude that the inequality holds for \( n + 1 \) which completes the proof by induction.

2025-01-27 00:11:15,081 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To establish the base case for \( n = 1 \) in the inequality \( (1+nx) \leq (1+x)^n \), we start by substituting \( n = 1 \) into the inequality:

\[
1 + 1 \cdot x \leq (1 + x)^1.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
1 + x \leq 1 + x.
\]

This statement is clearly true, as both sides are equal. Thus, the base case holds.

Now, since \( 1 + x = 1 + x \) for any real number \( x \), including those where \( x > -1 \), we confirm that the base case \( n = 1 \) is valid.

For the proof to proceed correctly, we can state that the base case holds true for \( n = 1 \) under the given conditions. This forms a solid foundation for the induction step that follows. 

Therefore, the base case is established successfully, showing that the inequality is true for \( n = 1 \) when \( x > -1 \). 

So, there is no need for an alternative step; the base case is already proven as necessary and sufficient for the induction step.

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:

1. **Understand the properties of odd integers**: Recognize that the sum of two odd integers is even. This means \( a+d \) and \( b+c \) being powers of 2 implies that they must also be even, confirming that both \( a \) and \( d \), as well as \( b \) and \( c \), are indeed odd integers.

2. **Set up the equations**: Given \( a+d = 2^k \) and \( b+c = 2^m \), we can express \( d \) and \( c \) in terms of \( a \) and \( b \). Specifically, \( d = 2^k - a \) and \( c = 2^m - b \). We can substitute these into the equation \( ad = bc \) to analyze the implications.

3. **Substitute and simplify**: Substitute \( d \) and \( c \) into the equation \( ad = bc \) to get \( a(2^k - a) = b(2^m - b) \). This forms a quadratic equation in terms of \( a \) and \( b \), which can be analyzed further for potential integer solutions.

4. **Analyze the resulting equation**: Look at the structure of the resulting equation after substitution. Since \( a \) and \( b \) are both odd integers and \( a < b < c < d \), we can explore the bounds of \( a \) and infer properties from the relationship between \( k \) and \( m \).

5. **Consider cases for \( a \)**: Test small values of \( a \) (starting from 1) and see if they lead to valid integer solutions for \( b, c, \) and \( d \). Since both \( a \) and \( d \) are bounded by \( 2^k \) and must remain odd integers, we can derive constraints on their values.

6. **Conclude**: Based on the analysis, derive a contradiction or validate that the only solution leading to all conditions being satisfied is \( a = 1 \). Use the properties of odd integers and the conditions established to finalize the proof.

{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Planner generated plan:\n0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:\n\n1. **Understand the properties of odd integers**: Recognize that the sum of two odd integers is even. This means \\( a+d \\) and \\( b+c \\) being powers of 2 implies that they must also be even, confirming that both \\( a \\) and \\( d \\), as well as \\( b \\) and \\( c \\), are indeed odd integers.\n\n2. **Set up the equations**: Given \\( a+d = 2^k \\) and \\( b+c = 2^m \\), we can express \\( d \\) and \\( c \\) in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\). Specifically, \\( d = 2^k - a \\) and \\( c = 2^m - b \\). We can substitute these into the equation \\( ad = bc \\) to analyze the implications.\n\n3. **Substitute and simplify**: Substitute \\( d \\) and \\( c \\) into the equation \\( ad = bc \\) to get \\( a(2^k - a) = b(2^m - b) \\). This forms a quadratic equation in terms of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\), which can be analyzed further for potential integer solutions.\n\n4. **Analyze the resulting equation**: Look at the structure of the resulting equation after substitution. Since \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are both odd integers and \\( a < b < c < d \\), we can explore the bounds of \\( a \\) and infer properties from the relationship between \\( k \\) and \\( m \\).\n\n5. **Consider cases for \\( a \\)**: Test small values of \\( a \\) (starting from 1) and see if they lead to valid integer solutions for \\( b, c, \\) and \\( d \\). Since both \\( a \\) and \\( d \\) are bounded by \\( 2^k \\) and must remain odd integers, we can derive constraints on their values.\n\n6. **Conclude**: Based on the analysis, derive a contradiction or validate that the only solution leading to all conditions being satisfied is \\( a = 1 \\). Use the properties of odd integers and the conditions established to finalize the proof.'},

2025-01-27 00:13:01,149 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To find the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4, we can first compute the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4 to identify any repeating patterns.

Let's calculate the first few terms of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4:

- F(1) = 1
- F(2) = 1
- F(3) = F(1) + F(2) = 1 + 1 = 2
- F(4) = F(2) + F(3) = 1 + 2 = 3
- F(5) = F(3) + F(4) = 2 + 3 = 5 mod 4 = 1
- F(6) = F(4) + F(5) = 3 + 1 = 4 mod 4 = 0
- F(7) = F(5) + F(6) = 1 + 0 = 1
- F(8) = F(6) + F(7) = 0 + 1 = 1
- F(9) = F(7) + F(8) = 1 + 1 = 2
- F(10) = F(8) + F(9) = 1 + 2 = 3
- F(11) = F(9) + F(10) = 2 + 3 = 5 mod 4 = 1
- F(12) = F(10) + F(11) = 3 + 1 = 4 mod 4 = 0

Now we have the sequence modulo 4:

1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0...

Observing the pattern, we see that it repeats every 6 terms:

1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0

Next, we find which term corresponds to F(100):

100 mod 6 = 4.

From the repeating sequence, the 4th term is:

1, 1, 2, 3 → The 4th term is 3.

Thus, the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4 is 3.

Now, I will present my guess in the required format:

2025-01-27 00:14:49,052 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To find the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\), we will calculate the units digit of each term individually.

1. **Finding the units digit of \(16^{17}\)**:
   The units digit of \(16\) is \(6\). We need to find the units digit of \(6^{17}\). 
   The units digit of \(6^n\) for any positive integer \(n\) is always \(6\).
   Therefore, the units digit of \(16^{17}\) is:
   \[
   6
   \]

2. **Finding the units digit of \(17^{18}\)**:
   The units digit of \(17\) is \(7\). We need to find the units digit of \(7^{18}\).
   The units digits of powers of \(7\) follow a cycle:
   - \(7^1 \equiv 7\) (units digit \(7\))
   - \(7^2 \equiv 49\) (units digit \(9\))
   - \(7^3 \equiv 343\) (units digit \(3\))
   - \(7^4 \equiv 2401\) (units digit \(1\))
   - Then it repeats: \(7, 9, 3, 1\).

   To find the position in the cycle for \(7^{18}\), we compute \(18 \mod 4\) (since there are 4 numbers in the cycle):
   \[
   18 \div 4 = 4 \quad \text{remainder } 2
   \]
   Thus, \(18 \mod 4 = 2\). From our cycle, the units digit corresponding to \(7^2\) is \(9\).
   Therefore, the units digit of \(17^{18}\) is:
   \[
   9
   \]

3. **Finding the units digit of \(18^{19}\)**:
   The units digit of \(18\) is \(8\). We need to find the units digit of \(8^{19}\).
   The units digits of powers of \(8\) follow a cycle:
   - \(8^1 \equiv 8\) (units digit \(8\))
   - \(8^2 \equiv 64\) (units digit \(4\))
   - \(8^3 \equiv 512\) (units digit \(2\))
   - \(8^4 \equiv 4096\) (units digit \(6\))
   - Then it repeats: \(8, 4, 2, 6\).

   To find the position in the cycle for \(8^{19}\), we compute \(19 \mod 4\):
   \[
   19 \div 4 = 4 \quad \text{remainder } 3
   \]
   Thus, \(19 \mod 4 = 3\). From our cycle, the units digit corresponding to \(8^3\) is \(2\).
   Therefore, the units digit of \(18^{19}\) is:
   \[
   2
   \]

Finally, we multiply the units digits of each component:
- Units digit of \(16^{17} = 6\)
- Units digit of \(17^{18} = 9\)
- Units digit of \(18^{19} = 2\)

Now, we find the units digit of the product \(6 \times 9 \times 2\):
\[
6 \times 9 = 54 \quad \text{(units digit is } 4\text{)}
\]
\[
4 \times 2 = 8 \quad \text{(units digit is } 8\text{)}
\]

Thus, the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\) is:
\[
\boxed{8}

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:

1. Start by simplifying the expression \(4^{n+1} + 20\). Notice that \(4^{n+1} = 4 \cdot 4^n\), so we can rewrite the expression as \(4 \cdot 4^n + 20\).

2. Next, check the divisibility of each component of the expression by 12. We will specifically analyze \(4 \cdot 4^n\) and \(20\) modulo 12 to see their contributions to the sum.

3. Calculate \(4 \cdot 4^n \mod 12\) for different values of \(n\) (starting from \(n = 1\), as \(n\) is a natural number) and check if a pattern arises.

4. Calculate \(20 \mod 12\) to find its equivalence class, which is \(20 \equiv 8 \mod 12\).

5. Combine the results of the previous steps to evaluate \(4 \cdot 4^n + 20 \mod 12\) and determine if it consistently equals 0 for any natural number \(n\).

1. Express the condition that \( X \) is 2 more than a multiple of 3 mathematically. This can be written as:
   \[
   X \equiv 2 \mod 3

2. Identify the condition for the units digit of \( X \) being the same as the units digit of a number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5. The number that is 4 more than a multiple of 5 can be expressed as:

   - The units digit of \( X \) is either 4 or 9.

\[
f(x) = 2x - 3
\]
Substituting \( x = 5 \):

\[
f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7
\]

Now we calculate \( f(5) - 1 \):

\[
f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6

\[

Substituting \( x = 6 \):

\[
g(6) = 6 + 1 = 7

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:

1. **Analyze the functional equation**: Start by rewriting the given equation \( f(x+a) = \frac{1}{2} + \sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \). Notice that the right-hand side involves a square root, which suggests that \( f(x) \) might be constrained between certain values. Specifically, since \( f(x) \) must be a valid output for the square root, ensure that \( 0 \leq f(x) \leq 1 \).

2. **Investigate the behavior of \( f(x) \)**: Define a new variable \( g(x) = f(x) - \frac{1}{2} \). This allows you to transform the functional equation into a potentially simpler form, which could yield insights into periodicity. Specifically, substitute \( g(x) \) into the equation to see if it reveals any repeating or cyclical patterns.

3. **Test for periodicity**: By substituting \( x \) with \( x + a \) in the original functional equation, derive another expression for \( f(x + 2a) \). This recursive application may help in finding a relation that suggests a periodicity over some interval that can lead to the discovery of the number \( b \).

{'role': 'user', 'content': 'Planner generated plan:\n0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:\n\n1. **Analyze the functional equation**: Start by rewriting the given equation \\( f(x+a) = \\frac{1}{2} + \\sqrt{f(x) - f(x)^2} \\). Notice that the right-hand side involves a square root, which suggests that \\( f(x) \\) might be constrained between certain values. Specifically, since \\( f(x) \\) must be a valid output for the square root, ensure that \\( 0 \\leq f(x) \\leq 1 \\).\n\n2. **Investigate the behavior of \\( f(x) \\)**: Define a new variable \\( g(x) = f(x) - \\frac{1}{2} \\). This allows you to transform the functional equation into a potentially simpler form, which could yield insights into periodicity. Specifically, substitute \\( g(x) \\) into the equation to see if it reveals any repeating or cyclical patterns.\n\n3. **Test for periodicity**: By substituting \\( x \\) with \\( x + a \\) in the original functional equation, derive another expression for \\( f(x + 2a) \\). This recursive application may help in finding a relation that suggests a periodicity over some interval that can lead to the discovery of the number \\( b \\).'},

1. **Square both sides** of the equation to eliminate the square root:
   \[
   (\sqrt{19 + 3y})^2 = 7^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   19 + 3y = 49
   \]

2. **Isolate the term with \(y\)** by subtracting 19 from both sides:
   \[
   3y = 49 - 19
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   3y = 30
   \]

3. **Solve for \(y\)** by dividing both sides by 3:
   \[
   y = \frac{30}{3}
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   y = 10
   \]

Thus, the value of \(y\) that satisfies the equation is:

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:

1. **Understand the Function**: Analyze the function \( f(x) \) as a linear combination of cosine terms. Since each cosine function has a period of \( 2\pi \), investigate how this periodicity influences the overall function \( f(x) \).

2. **Set Up the Equation**: Since \( f(x_1) = f(x_2) = 0 \), we can express these conditions in terms of the individual cosine components in \( f(x) \). This gives us two equations: 
   \[
   \cos(a_0 + x_1) + \frac{1}{2}\cos(a_1 + x_1) + \cdots + \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\cos(a_{n-1} + x_1) = 0
   \]
   and 
   \[
   \cos(a_0 + x_2) + \frac{1}{2}\cos(a_1 + x_2) + \cdots + \frac{1}{2^{n-1}}\cos(a_{n-1} + x_2) = 0.
   \]

3. **Subtract the Equations**: Subtract the two equations derived from \( f(x_1) \) and \( f(x_2) \) to find a relationship between \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \). This could lead to a sum of cosine terms being equal to zero.

4. **Use Trigonometric Identities**: Apply trigonometric identities such as the cosine difference identity, which states that \( \cos(A) - \cos(B) = -2\sin\left(\frac{A+B}{2}\right)\sin\left(\frac{A-B}{2}\right) \), to relate the angles and the differences \( x_2 - x_1 \).

5. **Analyze the Resulting Sine Function**: Since we have a product of sine functions equal to zero, determine the implications of this on the angles involved. This will imply that \( x_2 - x_1 \) must be a multiple of \( \pi \).

6. **Conclude with Integer Multiples**: From the analysis of the sine functions, conclude that \( x_2 - x_1 = m\pi \) for some integer \( m \), based on the periodic nature of the sine function.

Now, to find \( x \), we can divide both sides by \( 1.04 \):

\[
x = \frac{598}{1.04}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
x = 575
\]

Thus, last year's enrollment was 575 students.

Now, to provide a guess for last year's enrollment:

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:

1. Start by expressing the product \(\prod_{k=1}^n (1 + 1/k^3)\) in logarithmic form. This can simplify the multiplicative nature of the expression into an additive one: 
   \[
   \log \left( \prod_{k=1}^n (1 + 1/k^3) \right) = \sum_{k=1}^n \log(1 + 1/k^3).
   \]

2. Use the Taylor series expansion for \(\log(1 + x)\) around \(x = 0\) to approximate \(\log(1 + 1/k^3)\) for large \(k\): 
   \[
   \log(1 + 1/k^3) \approx \frac{1}{k^3} - \frac{1}{2k^6} + O\left(\frac{1}{k^9}\right).
   \]
   Then sum this approximation over \(k\) from \(1\) to \(n\).

2025-01-27 00:21:57,961 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To provide a guess for the inequality \(\prod_{k=1}^n (1 + 1/k^3) \leq 3 - 1/n\), we start by evaluating the left side. 

The term \(1 + 1/k^3\) approaches 1 as \(k\) increases, and since \(k\) starts from 1, the product will yield a value greater than 1 but less than 3 as \(n\) increases. The right-hand side, \(3 - 1/n\), approaches 3 as \(n\) increases, but remains slightly less than 3. 

This suggests that for larger values of \(n\), the product does seem bounded by the expression on the right. However, we must keep in mind that both sides behave differently as \(n\) changes. 

Considering this, my guess for the numerical answer to the inequality could be that as \(n\) increases, the product tends to stabilize, and we need to ensure that it does not exceed the right side. 

Therefore, I will guess:

2025-01-27 00:22:46,202 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To analyze the function \( f(x) = \frac{|x|}{1 + |x|} \), we can evaluate its behavior as \( x \) approaches 0 and \(\infty\).

1. **Limit as \( x \to 0 \)**:
   \[
   f(0) = \frac{|0|}{1 + |0|} = 0
   \]

2. **Limit as \( x \to \infty \)**:
   \[
   \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x}{1+x} = 1
   \]

Thus, the function \( f(x) \) approaches 0 when \( x = 0 \) and approaches 1 as \( x \) goes to infinity.

3. **Monotonicity**:
   To check the monotonicity of \( f(x) \), we can calculate its derivative:
   \[
   f'(x) = \frac{(1 + |x|)(\text{sgn}(x)) - |x|(\text{sgn}(x))}{(1 + |x|)^2} = \frac{1 + |x| - |x|}{(1 + |x|)^2} = \frac{1}{(1 + |x|)^2}
   \]
Since \( f'(x) > 0 \) for all \( x \neq 0 \), the function \( f(x) \) is monotonically increasing on its domain.

### Conclusions about the Original Inequality:
The function \( f(x) \) is continuous, non-negative, and monotonically increasing. This suggests that combining \( |a| \) and \( |b| \) (which are both non-negative) results in \( f(a) + f(b) \) being greater than or equal to \( f(a+b) \). 

The inequality \(\frac{|a+b|}{1+|a+b|}\leq \frac{|a|}{1+|a|}+\frac{|b|}{1+|b|}\) can be intuitively understood through the fact that as \( |a| \) and \( |b| \) increase, their contributions to \( f(a) \) and \( f(b) \) increase in a way that respects the upper bound given by \( f(a+b) \).

### Final Guess:
Given this analysis, a reasonable guess for the behavior of this function in relation to the inequality could be:

[START PROMPT]Given the problem statement, I need to determine the nice numbers between 2010 and 2019. A nice number is defined as a positive integer \( n \) for which there exists a positive integer \( m \) with exactly four positive divisors, and the sum of these divisors equals \( n \). 

First, recognize that a positive integer \( m \) has exactly four positive divisors if it is either of the form \( p^3 \) (where \( p \) is a prime), or of the form \( p_1 \cdot p_2 \) (where \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) are distinct primes). 

Next, for both forms, compute the sums of their divisors:

1. For \( m = p^3 \):
   - The divisors are \( 1, p, p^2, p^3 \).
   - The sum of the divisors is \( 1 + p + p^2 + p^3 = \frac{p^4 - 1}{p - 1} \).

2. For \( m = p_1 \cdot p_2 \):
   - The divisors are \( 1, p_1, p_2, p_1 \cdot p_2 \).
   - The sum of the divisors is \( 1 + p_1 + p_2 + p_1 \cdot p_2 = (p_1 + 1)(p_2 + 1) \).

Determine if each number in the range \( 2010, 2011, 2012, \ldots, 2019 \) can be expressed as the sum of the divisors for any suitable \( m \). Calculate the possible sums and check which values are obtained. Finally, compute the total of all nice numbers found.

2025-01-27 00:24:44,283 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To find the nice numbers in the set \( \{ 2010, 2011, 2012, \dots, 2019 \} \), we will explore the forms of \( m \) that yield four positive divisors and the corresponding sums.

### Case 1: \( m = p^3 \)
For \( m = p^3 \), the sum of the divisors is:
\[
S = 1 + p + p^2 + p^3 = \frac{p^4 - 1}{p - 1}
\]
We will calculate this for various small primes \( p \):

- For \( p = 2 \):
  \[
  S = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15
  \]
- For \( p = 3 \):
  \[
  S = 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40
  \]
- For \( p = 5 \):
  \[
  S = 1 + 5 + 25 + 125 = 156
  \]
- For \( p = 7 \):
  \[
  S = 1 + 7 + 49 + 343 = 400
  \]
- For \( p = 11 \):
  \[
  S = 1 + 11 + 121 + 1331 = 1464
  \]
- For \( p = 13 \):
  \[
  S = 1 + 13 + 169 + 2197 = 2380
  \]
  
From this, the sums \( S \) generated from \( p^3 \) for small primes are much less than \( 2010 \) and start exceeding by \( p = 13 \).

### Case 2: \( m = p_1 \cdot p_2 \)
For \( m = p_1 \cdot p_2 \), the sum of the divisors is:
\[
S = (p_1 + 1)(p_2 + 1)
\]

We can try small pairs of distinct primes \( (p_1, p_2) \):

- For \( (2, 3) \):
  \[
  S = (2 + 1)(3 + 1) = 3 \cdot 4 = 12
  \]
- For \( (2, 5) \):
  \[
  S = (2 + 1)(5 + 1) = 3 \cdot 6 = 18
  \]
- For \( (2, 7) \):
  \[
  S = (2 + 1)(7 + 1) = 3 \cdot 8 = 24
  \]
- For \( (2, 11) \):
  \[
  S = (2 + 1)(11 + 1) = 3 \cdot 12 = 36
  \]
- For \( (3, 5) \):
  \[
  S = (3 + 1)(5 + 1) = 4 \cdot 6 = 24
  \]
- For \( (3, 7) \):
  \[
  S = (3 + 1)(7 + 1) = 4 \cdot 8 = 32
  \]
- For \( (3, 11) \):
  \[
  S = (3 + 1)(11 + 1) = 4 \cdot 12 = 48
  \]
- For \( (5, 7) \):
  \[
  S = (5 + 1)(7 + 1) = 6 \cdot 8 = 48
  \]
- For \( (2, 13) \):
  \[
  S = (2 + 1)(13 + 1) = 3 \cdot 14 = 42
  \]

Continuing this process with higher primes, we can generate more values. 

After computing various \( S \), we will check which of \( S \) values fall in the range \( 2010 \) to \( 2019 \):
- None of the calculations for nice numbers will yield results in the range \( \{ 2010, 2011, 2012, \ldots, 2019 \} \).

### Conclusion
Since none of the \( n \) values from \( 2010 \) to \( 2019 \) can be written as sums of the divisors of numbers with exactly four divisors, we conclude that there are no nice numbers in this range.

Thus, the sum of all nice numbers in the set \( \{ 2010, 2011, 2012, \ldots, 2019 \} \

2025-01-27 00:24:52,904 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To provide a guess for the unique positive integer \( N \) that maximizes \( f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{n^{1/3}} \), we consider that values of \( n \) that are highly composite or have many divisors tend to yield higher values of \( d(n) \). 

From previous analysis of similar problems, the number \( 36 \) is known to have a high number of divisors for its size:

- \( d(36) = 9 \) because the divisors of \( 36 \) are \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36 \).
- Thus, \( f(36) = \frac{9}{36^{1/3}} \).

We can calculate \( 36^{1/3} \):
\[
36^{1/3} = 6^{2/3} = 2^{4/3} \cdot 3^{2/3}
\]

Calculating the approximate values for \( f(36) \):
\[
f(36) \approx \frac{9}{6} = 1.5
\]

For comparison, we might compute \( f(n) \) for some other integers such as \( 24, 30, 60 \) etc., but it appears \( N = 36 \) is a strong candidate.

Since \( N = 36 \), we find the sum of its digits:
\[
3 + 6 = 9
\]

Thus, I will provide my guess for the problem statement.

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:
1. Use the change of base formula for logarithms, which states that \(\log_a b = \frac{\log_c b}{\log_c a}\). I can apply this to rewrite \(\log_{40} 2\) and \(\log_{20} 2\) in terms of base 2:

   - \(\log_{20} 2 = \frac{\log_2 2}{\log_2 20} = \frac{1}{\log_2 20}\)

2. Substitute these expressions back into the original equation:

2025-01-27 00:25:21,290 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To find the remainder when \( 2x \) is divided by 5, we start with the information given:

1. \( x \equiv 3 \mod 5 \). This means that when \( x \) is divided by 5, the remainder is 3.

Now, let's multiply both sides of the congruence by 2:

\[
2x \equiv 2 \cdot 3 \mod 5
\]

Calculating the right-hand side:

\[
2 \cdot 3 = 6
\]

Next, we find the remainder of 6 when divided by 5:

\[
6 \div 5 = 1 \quad \text{(with a remainder of 1)}
\]

Thus, 

\[
6 \equiv 1 \mod 5
\]

So, we have:

\[
2x \equiv 1 \mod 5
\]

Therefore, the remainder when \( 2x \) is divided by 5 is 1.

Now, as per your request for a numerical guess, my guess for the answer is:
