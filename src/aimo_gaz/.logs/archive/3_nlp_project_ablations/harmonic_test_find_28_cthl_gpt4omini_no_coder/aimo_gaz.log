2024-12-11 14:49:43,362 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To solve the problem, we can combine the two representations of the numbers:

1. From the expressions given:
   \[
   AMC10 + AMC12 = (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 10) + (10000A + 1000M + 100C + 12)
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   20000A + 2000M + 200C + 22
   \]

2. Setting this equal to the given sum:
   \[
   20000A + 2000M + 200C + 22 = 123422
   \]

3. Subtracting 22 from both sides:
   \[
   20000A + 2000M + 200C = 123400
   \]

4. Dividing the entire equation by 200:
   \[
   100A + 10M + C = 617
   \]

Now, we need to find values for \(A\), \(M\), and \(C\) such that \(A\), \(M\), and \(C\) are digits (from 0 to 9).

- Since \(A\) is the leading digit, the maximum value for \(A\) can be 6 (because \(100A\) must be less than or equal to 617).

Let’s try \(A = 6\):
\[
100(6) + 10M + C = 617 \implies 600 + 10M + C = 617 \implies 10M + C = 17
\]

- The possible values for \(M\) and \(C\) such that \(10M + C = 17\) can be:
  - \(M = 1\) and \(C = 7\)
  - \(M = 0\) and \(C = 17\) (not possible since \(C\) must be a single digit)

So \(A = 6\), \(M = 1\), and \(C = 7\) are valid digits.

Now we can find \(A + M + C\):
\[
A + M + C = 6 + 1 + 7 = 14
\]

Thus, the final guess for the numerical answer is:

2024-12-11 14:49:50,454 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To solve the equation \( x(x + 2) = 288 \), we first expand it:

\[
x^2 + 2x - 288 = 0
\]

Next, we can use the quadratic formula, where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -288 \):

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-288)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]

Calculating the discriminant:

\[
b^2 - 4ac = 4 + 1152 = 1156
\]

Now calculate \( \sqrt{1156} \):

\[
\sqrt{1156} = 34
\]

Substituting back into the formula gives:

\[
x = \frac{-2 \pm 34}{2}
\]

Calculating the two possible values for \( x \):

1. \( x = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \)
2. \( x = \frac{-36}{2} = -18 \) (not a positive integer)

Thus, the first even integer is \( x = 16 \), and the next consecutive even integer is:

\[
x + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18
\]

Therefore, the greater of the two integers is 18.

So my guess for the numerical answer is:

2024-12-11 14:49:59,271 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To find the factors of 2005, we can start by factoring it:

1. Check for divisibility by small prime numbers:
   - 2005 is odd, so not divisible by 2.
   - The sum of the digits (2 + 0 + 0 + 5 = 7) is not divisible by 3, so not divisible by 3.
   - The last digit is 5, so it is divisible by 5:
     - \(2005 ÷ 5 = 401\).

2. Now we factor 401. Check divisibility by small primes:
   - 401 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, or 19.
   - By testing up to the square root of 401 (~20), we find that 401 is a prime number.

Thus, the complete factorization of 2005 is:
\[ 2005 = 5 \times 401 \]

Now we have the factors 5 and 401. 

3. The pairs of factors (excluding 1) are:
   - (5, 401)

4. Calculate the sum of the two numbers:
\[ 5 + 401 = 406 \]

So, the sum of the two positive whole numbers that multiply to 2005 is 406.

2024-12-11 14:50:06,093 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To solve the problem, we first need to factor the number 2005.

1. The prime factorization of 2005:
   - 2005 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.
   - The sum of the digits of 2005 (2 + 0 + 0 + 5 = 7) is not divisible by 3, so it is not divisible by 3.
   - It does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
   - Dividing by 5, we get: 2005 ÷ 5 = 401.
   - Now we need to factor 401. Checking smaller prime numbers:
     - It is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, or 23.
     - It turns out that 401 is a prime number.

So, the prime factorization of 2005 is: 5 × 401.

2. The pairs of factors of 2005 are:
   - (5, 401)

Both factors are greater than 1. 

3. Now we calculate their sum:
   - 5 + 401 = 406.

Thus, the sum of the two numbers is 406.

Now, I will write my guess for the numerical answer.

2024-12-11 14:50:12,723 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To solve the problem, let's follow your steps:

1. **Prime Factorization of 2005**:
   - First, we check if 2005 is divisible by small prime numbers:
     - 2005 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.
     - The sum of the digits (2 + 0 + 0 + 5 = 7) is not divisible by 3, so 2005 is not divisible by 3.
     - 2005 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5: \( 2005 \div 5 = 401 \).
     - Now, we need to factor 401. 
     - Checking 401 against small primes: it is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, or 23.
     - After checking, we find that 401 is actually prime.

   Therefore, the prime factorization of 2005 is \( 5 \times 401 \).

2. **Factor Pairs**:
   - The factor pairs of 2005 (both greater than 1) are:
     - \( (5, 401) \)

3. **Sum of the Factor Pair**:
   - Now, we calculate the sum of these factors:
     - \( 5 + 401 = 406 \)

Thus, the answer to the problem, which is the sum of the two numbers whose product is 2005, is 406.

Now, I will provide my guess for the numerical answer to this problem.

2024-12-11 14:50:19,203 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To solve the problem, let's first perform the prime factorization of 2005.

1. The prime factorization of 2005:
   - Divide by 5 (since 2005 ends in 5): 
     2005 ÷ 5 = 401.
   - Now, check if 401 is a prime number. It is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, or 13.
   - Since it is not divisible by any prime numbers up to its square root (approximately 20), 401 is a prime number.

So, the prime factorization of 2005 is:
\[ 2005 = 5 \times 401 \]

2. The pairs of factors of 2005 (excluding 1) are:
   - (5, 401)

3. Now, find the sum of the two factors:
   \[ 5 + 401 = 406 \]

Thus, the sum of the two numbers whose product is 2005 is 406.

Now, I will provide my guess for the numerical answer.

2024-12-11 14:50:25,593 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To find the factors of 2005, we can start with prime factorization.

1. **Check for divisibility**:
   - 2005 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.
   - For 3, the sum of the digits (2 + 0 + 0 + 5 = 7) is not divisible by 3, so 2005 is not divisible by 3.
   - The last digit is 5, so 2005 is divisible by 5: \( 2005 \div 5 = 401 \).

2. **Factor 401**:
   - Check if 401 is prime. It's not divisible by 2, 3, 5 (as it's not ending in 0 or 5), and checking up to the square root of 401 (approximately 20.02):
     - 401 is not divisible by 7, 11, 13, 17, or 19.

Thus, 401 is prime. The prime factorization of 2005 is \( 5 \times 401 \).

3. **Identify pairs**:
   - The pairs of factors (both greater than 1) are:
     - \( (5, 401) \)

4. **Calculate the sum**:
   - The sum of these two numbers is \( 5 + 401 = 406 \).

Thus, the answer is:

2024-12-11 14:50:33,586 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To proceed with the substitution and simplify:

1. Substitute \(a\) into the first equation:
   \[
   \left(\frac{27}{4} b^3\right)^2 b^3 = \frac{32}{27}.
   \]

2. This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{729}{16} b^6 = \frac{32}{27}.
   \]

3. To isolate \(b^6\), multiply both sides by \(\frac{16}{729}\):
   \[
   b^6 = \frac{32}{27} \cdot \frac{16}{729} = \frac{512}{19683}.
   \]

4. Taking the sixth root:
   \[
   b = \left(\frac{512}{19683}\right)^{1/6} = \frac{2^{9/6}}{3^{9/6}} = \frac{4}{9}.
   \]

5. Substitute \(b\) back to find \(a\):
   \[
   a = \frac{27}{4} b^3 = \frac{27}{4} \left(\frac{4}{9}\right)^3 = \frac{27}{4} \cdot \frac{64}{729} = \frac{432}{2916} = \frac{8}{54} = \frac{4}{27}.
   \]

Now, calculate \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = \frac{4}{27} + \frac{4}{9} = \frac{4}{27} + \frac{12}{27} = \frac{16}{27}.
\]

Thus, my guess for \(a + b\) is:

0. I would break down the problem into simpler steps, this can be done by the following:
1. Take the logarithm of each equation to express \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) in terms of logarithms:
   - From \(4^{a}=5\), we get \(a = \frac{\log(5)}{\log(4)}\).
   - From \(5^{b}=6\), we get \(b = \frac{\log(6)}{\log(5)}\).
   - From \(6^{c}=7\), we get \(c = \frac{\log(7)}{\log(6)}\).
   - From \(7^{d}=8\), we get \(d = \frac{\log(8)}{\log(7)}\).
2. Substitute these expressions into the product \(abcd\):
   \[
   abcd = \left(\frac{\log(5)}{\log(4)}\right) \left(\frac{\log(6)}{\log(5)}\right) \left(\frac{\log(7)}{\log(6)}\right) \left(\frac{\log(8)}{\log(7)}\right)
   \]
   Simplifying this product will help in calculating \(abcd\).

2024-12-11 14:50:48,173 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To simplify the product \(abcd\), we see that the logarithms cancel:

\[
abcd = \frac{\log(5)}{\log(4)} \cdot \frac{\log(6)}{\log(5)} \cdot \frac{\log(7)}{\log(6)} \cdot \frac{\log(8)}{\log(7)}
\]

After cancellation, we are left with:

\[
abcd = \frac{\log(8)}{\log(4)}
\]

Now, we can express \(\log(8)\) and \(\log(4)\):

\[
\log(8) = \log(2^3) = 3\log(2)
\]
\[
\log(4) = \log(2^2) = 2\log(2)
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
abcd = \frac{3\log(2)}{2\log(2)} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

Therefore, the final answer for \(abcd\) is:

2024-12-11 14:50:59,532 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To find the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4, we can compute the Fibonacci numbers and look for a pattern. Let's start calculating the Fibonacci sequence modulo 4:

1. F(1) = 1 % 4 = 1
2. F(2) = 1 % 4 = 1
3. F(3) = (F(1) + F(2)) % 4 = (1 + 1) % 4 = 2
4. F(4) = (F(2) + F(3)) % 4 = (1 + 2) % 4 = 3
5. F(5) = (F(3) + F(4)) % 4 = (2 + 3) % 4 = 1
6. F(6) = (F(4) + F(5)) % 4 = (3 + 1) % 4 = 0
7. F(7) = (F(5) + F(6)) % 4 = (1 + 0) % 4 = 1
8. F(8) = (F(6) + F(7)) % 4 = (0 + 1) % 4 = 1
9. F(9) = (F(7) + F(8)) % 4 = (1 + 1) % 4 = 2
10. F(10) = (F(8) + F(9)) % 4 = (1 + 2) % 4 = 3
11. F(11) = (F(9) + F(10)) % 4 = (2 + 3) % 4 = 1
12. F(12) = (F(10) + F(11)) % 4 = (3 + 1) % 4 = 0

Continuing this process, we observe the following pattern:

- The Fibonacci sequence modulo 4 starts repeating every 6 terms:
1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0

To find F(100) % 4, we find 100 mod 6, since the sequence repeats every 6 terms. 

100 mod 6 = 4.

Thus, F(100) corresponds to F(4) in the pattern.

From our earlier calculations, F(4) % 4 = 3.

Therefore, the remainder when the 100th term of the Fibonacci sequence is divided by 4 is 3.

2024-12-11 14:51:09,248 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To solve the compound inequality step by step:

1. From the previous steps, we have:
   \(-5.6 + 2 \leq x \leq 5.6 + 2\).

2. Calculating the left side:
   \(-5.6 + 2 = -3.6\).

3. Calculating the right side:
   \(5.6 + 2 = 7.6\).

Thus, we have:
\(-3.6 \leq x \leq 7.6\).

Now we need to determine the integers within this range. The integers that satisfy this inequality are:
\(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\).

Counting these integers, we find there are 11 integers.

Therefore, my guess for the numerical answer is:

Here, \( a = 1 \) and \( b = -14 \).

Now substituting the values into the formula:

\[
x = -\frac{-14}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{14}{2} = 7
\]

Thus, the value of \( x \) at which the quadratic obtains its minimum value is 7.

Therefore, my guess for the numerical answer to this problem is:

2024-12-11 14:51:36,938 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To find the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\), we can analyze each term's units digit individually.

1. **Units digit of \(16^{17}\)**:
   - The units digit of \(16\) is \(6\).
   - The units digit of \(16^n\) for any positive integer \(n\) is always \(6\).
   - Therefore, the units digit of \(16^{17}\) is \(6\).

2. **Units digit of \(17^{18}\)**:
   - The units digit of \(17\) is \(7\).
   - Let's find the pattern in the units digits of powers of \(7\):
     - \(7^1 = 7\) (units digit is \(7\))
     - \(7^2 = 49\) (units digit is \(9\))
     - \(7^3 = 343\) (units digit is \(3\))
     - \(7^4 = 2401\) (units digit is \(1\))
     - \(7^5 = 16807\) (units digit is \(7\), and the pattern repeats every 4 terms: \(7, 9, 3, 1\)).
   - To find the units digit of \(7^{18}\), we compute \(18 \mod 4\):
     - \(18 \mod 4 = 2\), so the units digit of \(7^{18}\) corresponds to the second term in the pattern, which is \(9\).

3. **Units digit of \(18^{19}\)**:
   - The units digit of \(18\) is \(8\).
   - Let's find the pattern in the units digits of powers of \(8\):
     - \(8^1 = 8\) (units digit is \(8\))
     - \(8^2 = 64\) (units digit is \(4\))
     - \(8^3 = 512\) (units digit is \(2\))
     - \(8^4 = 4096\) (units digit is \(6\))
     - \(8^5 = 32768\) (units digit is \(8\), and the pattern repeats every 4 terms: \(8, 4, 2, 6\)).
   - To find the units digit of \(8^{19}\), we compute \(19 \mod 4\):
     - \(19 \mod 4 = 3\), so the units digit of \(8^{19}\) corresponds to the third term in the pattern, which is \(2\).

Now we can combine the units digits:
- The units digit of \(16^{17}\) is \(6\).
- The units digit of \(17^{18}\) is \(9\).
- The units digit of \(18^{19}\) is \(2\).

Finally, we compute the units digit of the product \(6 \times 9 \times 2\):
- First, compute \(6 \times 9 = 54\), which has a units digit of \(4\).
- Next, compute \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

Thus, the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\) is \(8\).

My guess for the numerical answer is:

2024-12-11 14:51:48,246 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To find the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\), we will follow the steps outlined:

1. **Calculate the units digit of \(16^{17}\)**:
   - The units digit of 16 is 6.
   - The units digit of powers of 6 is always 6 (since \(6^1 = 6\), \(6^2 = 36\), \(6^3 = 216\), etc.).
   - Thus, the units digit of \(16^{17}\) is **6**.

2. **Calculate the units digit of \(17^{18}\)**:
   - The units digit of 17 is 7.
   - The units digits of powers of 7 cycle every 4: 
     - \(7^1 = 7\),
     - \(7^2 = 49\) (units digit is 9),
     - \(7^3 = 343\) (units digit is 3),
     - \(7^4 = 2401\) (units digit is 1),
     - \(7^5 = 16807\) (units digit is 7, cycle repeats).
   - To find the units digit of \(7^{18}\), we find \(18 \mod 4 = 2\).
   - Therefore, the units digit of \(17^{18}\) is **9**.

3. **Calculate the units digit of \(18^{19}\)**:
   - The units digit of 18 is 8.
   - The units digits of powers of 8 cycle every 4:
     - \(8^1 = 8\),
     - \(8^2 = 64\) (units digit is 4),
     - \(8^3 = 512\) (units digit is 2),
     - \(8^4 = 4096\) (units digit is 6),
     - \(8^5 = 32768\) (units digit is 8, cycle repeats).
   - To find the units digit of \(8^{19}\), we find \(19 \mod 4 = 3\).
   - Therefore, the units digit of \(18^{19}\) is **2**.

4. **Multiply the units digits obtained**:
   - The units digits we have are: \(6\) (from \(16^{17}\)), \(9\) (from \(17^{18}\)), and \(2\) (from \(18^{19}\)).
   - Now we calculate the units digit of \(6 \times 9 \times 2\):
     - First, \(6 \times 9 = 54\) (units digit is 4).
     - Next, \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

Thus, the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\) is **8**.

2024-12-11 14:52:02,392 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: Continuing from your steps:

1. The units digit of \(16^{17}\) is \(6\).
2. For \(17^{18}\), the units digit of \(17\) is \(7\). The units digits of powers of \(7\) cycle every 4:
   - \(7^1\) has a units digit of \(7\)
   - \(7^2\) has a units digit of \(9\)
   - \(7^3\) has a units digit of \(3\)
   - \(7^4\) has a units digit of \(1\)
   Therefore, to find \(7^{18}\), we calculate \(18 \mod 4\) which gives \(2\). Thus, the units digit of \(17^{18}\) is \(9\).

3. For \(18^{19}\), the units digit of \(18\) is \(8\). The units digits of powers of \(8\) also cycle every 4:
   - \(8^1\) has a units digit of \(8\)
   - \(8^2\) has a units digit of \(4\)
   - \(8^3\) has a units digit of \(2\)
   - \(8^4\) has a units digit of \(6\)
   Thus, \(19 \mod 4\) gives \(3\). Therefore, the units digit of \(18^{19}\) is \(2\).

Now, we combine the units digits:
- The units digit of \(16^{17}\) is \(6\).
- The units digit of \(17^{18}\) is \(9\).
- The units digit of \(18^{19}\) is \(2\).

Next, we calculate the units digit of \(6 \times 9 \times 2\):
- First, \(6 \times 9 = 54\) (units digit \(4\)).
- Then, \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

Thus, the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\) is \(8\).

So my final guess for the numerical answer to this problem is:

3. Next, we find the units digit of \(17^{18}\). The units digit of \(17\) is \(7\). The pattern for the units digits of powers of \(7\) is as follows:
   - \(7^1 \equiv 7\)
   - \(7^2 \equiv 49 \equiv 9\)
   - \(7^3 \equiv 343 \equiv 3\)
   - \(7^4 \equiv 2401 \equiv 1\)
   - This pattern (7, 9, 3, 1) repeats every 4 terms.

   To find \(7^{18}\), we calculate \(18 \mod 4\), which gives \(2\). Thus, the units digit of \(17^{18}\) (or \(7^{18}\)) is \(9\).

4. Finally, we find the units digit of \(18^{19}\). The units digit of \(18\) is \(8\). The pattern for the units digits of powers of \(8\) is:
   - \(8^1 \equiv 8\)
   - \(8^2 \equiv 64 \equiv 4\)
   - \(8^3 \equiv 512 \equiv 2\)
   - \(8^4 \equiv 4096 \equiv 6\)
   - This pattern (8, 4, 2, 6) repeats every 4 terms.

   To find \(8^{19}\), we compute \(19 \mod 4\), which gives \(3\). Thus, the units digit of \(18^{19}\) (or \(8^{19}\)) is \(2\).

Now, we multiply the units digits of each term:
- Units digit of \(16^{17}\) is \(6\)
- Units digit of \(17^{18}\) is \(9\)
- Units digit of \(18^{19}\) is \(2\)

We compute the product of the units digits:
\[
6 \times 9 = 54 \quad \text{(units digit is 4)}
\]
\[
4 \times 2 = 8 \quad \text{(units digit is 8)}
\]

Thus, the units digit of \(16^{17} \times 17^{18} \times 18^{19}\) is \(8\).

2024-12-11 14:52:31,522 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To solve for the smallest positive integer \( X \) that satisfies both conditions, we have:

1. From the first condition, \( X \equiv 2 \mod 3 \). This means that \( X \) can be expressed as \( X = 3k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \).
2. From the second condition, \( X \equiv 4 \mod 5 \). This means that \( X \) can be expressed as \( X = 5m + 4 \) for some integer \( m \).

Now, we need to solve these two congruences simultaneously.

Starting with the first congruence:
- \( X \equiv 2 \mod 3 \) gives us the possible values for \( X \): 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, ...

Now applying the second congruence:
- We need to find which of these values also satisfies \( X \equiv 4 \mod 5 \):
  - \( 2 \mod 5 \) is 2 (not a match)
  - \( 5 \mod 5 \) is 0 (not a match)
  - \( 8 \mod 5 \) is 3 (not a match)
  - \( 11 \mod 5 \) is 1 (not a match)
  - \( 14 \mod 5 \) is 4 (match)

Since 14 satisfies both conditions \( X \equiv 2 \mod 3 \) and \( X \equiv 4 \mod 5 \), we can conclude that the smallest possible value of \( X \) is 14.

Thus, the guess for the numerical answer is:
[START GUESS] 14

2024-12-11 14:52:46,853 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To solve for \( x \), we start with the equation:

\[
2+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{2+\frac{2}{3+x}}}=\frac{144}{53}
\]

1. Start by simplifying the innermost fraction \( \frac{2}{3+x} \).
   Let \( y = 3+x \) so that \( \frac{2}{3+x} = \frac{2}{y} \). 

2. Next, simplify \( 2 + \frac{2}{y} \):
   \[
   2 + \frac{2}{y} = \frac{2y + 2}{y} = \frac{2(y+1)}{y}
   \]

3. Now, substitute this back into the next layer:
   \[
   1 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{2}{3+x}} = 1 + \frac{1}{\frac{2(y+1)}{y}} = 1 + \frac{y}{2(y+1)} = \frac{2(y+1) + y}{2(y+1)} = \frac{3y + 2}{2(y+1)}
   \]

4. Then we can simplify the outer fraction:
   \[
   \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{2}{3+x}}} = \frac{2(y+1)}{3y + 2}
   \]

5. Now, substitute this into the original expression:
   \[
   2 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{2}{3+x}}} = 2 + \frac{2(y+1)}{3y + 2} = \frac{2(3y + 2) + 2(y + 1)}{3y + 2} = \frac{6y + 4 + 2y + 2}{3y + 2} = \frac{8y + 6}{3y + 2}
   \]

6. Set this equal to \( \frac{144}{53} \):
   \[
   \frac{8y + 6}{3y + 2} = \frac{144}{53}
   \]

7. Cross multiply to eliminate the fractions:
   \[
   53(8y + 6) = 144(3y + 2)
   \]
   This expands to:
   \[
   424y + 318 = 432y + 288
   \]

8. Rearranging gives:
   \[
   424y - 432y = 288 - 318
   \]
   \[
   -8y = -30 \Rightarrow y = \frac{30}{8} = \frac{15}{4}
   \]

9. Since \( y = 3 + x \), we find:
   \[
   3 + x = \frac{15}{4}
   \]
   Thus:
   \[
   x = \frac{15}{4} - 3 = \frac{15}{4} - \frac{12}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
   \]

Therefore, the solution for \( x \) is:

2024-12-11 14:52:59,167 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To solve the equation \( 2 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{2}{3+x}}} = \frac{144}{53} \), let's simplify the left-hand side step by step.

1. Start from the innermost part: \( 2 + \frac{2}{3+x} \).
   - Let \( y = 3+x \), then we have \( 2 + \frac{2}{y} = 2 + \frac{2}{3+x} = \frac{2y + 2}{y} = \frac{2(3+x) + 2}{3+x} = \frac{6 + 2x + 2}{3+x} = \frac{8 + 2x}{3+x} \).

2. Next, we need to simplify \( \frac{1}{2 + \frac{2}{3+x}} \):
   - This gives \( \frac{1}{\frac{8 + 2x}{3+x}} = \frac{3+x}{8 + 2x} \).

3. Now, simplify \( 1 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{2}{3+x}} \):
   - This gives \( 1 + \frac{3+x}{8 + 2x} = \frac{(8 + 2x) + (3 + x)}{8 + 2x} = \frac{11 + 3x}{8 + 2x} \).

4. Now, we need to evaluate \( \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{2}{3+x}}} \):
   - This results in \( \frac{8 + 2x}{11 + 3x} \).

5. Finally, plug this into the outer expression: 
   - \( 2 + \frac{8 + 2x}{11 + 3x} = \frac{2(11 + 3x) + (8 + 2x)}{11 + 3x} = \frac{22 + 6x + 8 + 2x}{11 + 3x} = \frac{30 + 8x}{11 + 3x} \).

Now we can set this equal to the right-hand side:

\[
\frac{30 + 8x}{11 + 3x} = \frac{144}{53}.
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
53(30 + 8x) = 144(11 + 3x).
\]

Expanding both sides:

\[
1590 + 424x = 1584 + 432x.
\]

Now, subtract \( 424x \) from both sides:

\[
1590 = 1584 + 8x.
\]

Subtract \( 1584 \) from both sides:

\[
6 = 8x \implies x = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Thus, the value of \( x \) is \( \frac{3}{4} \).

Now, I will write my guess for the answer:

2024-12-11 14:53:17,997 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To solve the equation \(2+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{2+\frac{2}{3+x}}}=\frac{144}{53}\), we will simplify the left-hand side step by step. 

Let's start by simplifying the innermost fraction:

1. Rewrite \(2+\frac{2}{3+x}\):
   \[
   2 + \frac{2}{3+x} = \frac{(2)(3+x) + 2}{3+x} = \frac{6 + 2x + 2}{3+x} = \frac{8 + 2x}{3+x}
   \]

2. Now substitute this back into the next fraction:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2 + \frac{2}{3+x}} = \frac{1}{\frac{8 + 2x}{3+x}} = \frac{3+x}{8 + 2x}
   \]

3. Now we can substitute this into the next layer:
   \[
   1 + \frac{1}{2+\frac{2}{3+x}} = 1 + \frac{3+x}{8 + 2x} = \frac{(8 + 2x) + (3+x)}{8 + 2x} = \frac{11 + 3x}{8 + 2x}
   \]

4. Next, we take the reciprocal:
   \[
   \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{2}{3+x}}} = \frac{8 + 2x}{11 + 3x}
   \]

5. Now add this to 2:
   \[
   2 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{2}{3+x}}} = 2 + \frac{8 + 2x}{11 + 3x} = \frac{2(11 + 3x) + (8 + 2x)}{11 + 3x} = \frac{22 + 6x + 8 + 2x}{11 + 3x} = \frac{30 + 8x}{11 + 3x}
   \]

So now we have:
\[
\frac{30 + 8x}{11 + 3x} = \frac{144}{53}
\]

6. Cross-multiply to eliminate the fractions:
   \[
   53(30 + 8x) = 144(11 + 3x)
   \]
   Expanding both sides gives:
   \[
   1590 + 424x = 1584 + 432x
   \]
   Rearranging terms leads to:
   \[
   1590 - 1584 = 432x - 424x
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   6 = 8x \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4}
   \]

Thus, the value of \(x\) is \(\frac{3}{4}\).

2024-12-11 14:53:26,440 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To solve the equation \( 2+\frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{2+\frac{2}{3+x}}}=\frac{144}{53} \), we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the innermost fraction:
   \[
   2 + \frac{2}{3 + x}
   \]

2. Rewrite the equation:
   \[
   1 + \frac{1}{2 + \frac{2}{3 + x}} = 1 + \frac{1}{\frac{(2(3+x) + 2)}{3+x}} = 1 + \frac{3+x}{2(3+x) + 2}
   \]

3. Substitute back to find the common denominator:
   \[
   2 + \frac{1}{1 + \frac{3+x}{2(3+x) + 2}} = 2 + \frac{1}{\frac{(2(3+x) + 2) + (3+x)}{2(3+x) + 2}}

4. Continuing to simplify:
   \[
   2 + \frac{1}{\frac{6 + 2x + 2 + 3 + x}{2(3+x) + 2}} = 2 + \frac{2(3+x) + 2}{11 + 3x}
   \]

5. Set the left side equal to \( \frac{144}{53} \) and solve for \( x \).

After performing the calculation steps correctly, we will find the value of \( x \). 

Based on my calculations, I guess the numerical answer for \( x \) is:

2024-12-11 14:53:34,088 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To find the value of \(\frac{z}{x}\), we can substitute \(y\) from the first equation into the second equation.

1. From \(2x = 5y\), we have:
   \[
   y = \frac{2x}{5}
   \]

2. Now substitute \(y\) into \(z = \frac{7y}{10}\):
   \[
   z = \frac{7 \left(\frac{2x}{5}\right)}{10} = \frac{14x}{50} = \frac{7x}{25}
   \]

Now we can find \(\frac{z}{x}\):
\[
\frac{z}{x} = \frac{\frac{7x}{25}}{x} = \frac{7}{25}
\]

So, the value of \(\frac{z}{x}\) expressed as a common fraction is \(\frac{7}{25}\).

Now, I will write my guess for the numerical answer.

   \[
   f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7
   \]

2. Now, compute \( f(5) - 1 \):

2024-12-11 14:53:48,174 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To find \( g(f(5)-1) \), we first need to evaluate \( f(5) \).

1. Calculate \( f(5) \):
   \[
   f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7
   \]

2. Now, subtract \( 1 \) from \( f(5) \):
   \[
   f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6
   \]

3. Next, we will find \( g(6) \) using the function \( g(x) = x + 1 \):
   \[
   g(6) = 6 + 1 = 7
   \]

Thus, the value of \( g(f(5)-1) \) is \( 7 \).

My guess for the numerical answer to this problem is:

2024-12-11 14:53:56,523 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: Let's proceed with the calculations based on the steps provided.

1. Evaluate \( f(5) \):
   \[
   f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7.
   \]

2. Subtract 1 from \( f(5) \):
   \[
   f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6.
   \]

3. Now, evaluate \( g(6) \) using the function \( g(x) = x + 1 \):
   \[
   g(6) = 6 + 1 = 7.
   \]

Thus, the value of \( g(f(5) - 1) \) is 7.

2. Subtract 1 from the result:

2024-12-11 14:54:18,939 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To find \(5^{100} \mod 1000\), we can compute \(5^{100} \mod 8\) and \(5^{100} \mod 125\) and then combine the results using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

1. **Calculating \(5^{100} \mod 8\)**:
   \[
   5 \equiv 5 \mod 8
   \]
   \[
   5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 1 \mod 8
   \]
   Since \(5^2 \equiv 1\), it follows that:
   \[
   5^{100} = (5^2)^{50} \equiv 1^{50} \equiv 1 \mod 8
   \]

2. **Calculating \(5^{100} \mod 125\)**:
   \[
   5^{100} = (5^3)^{33} \cdot 5 \equiv 0 \mod 125
   \]
   Since \(5^3 = 125\), any higher power of 5 will also be congruent to 0 modulo 125.

Now we have:
\[
5^{100} \equiv 1 \mod 8
\]
\[
5^{100} \equiv 0 \mod 125
\]

Next, we can use the method of substitution to solve the system of congruences:

Let \(x\) be such that:
\[
x \equiv 0 \mod 125
\]
This means we can write \(x\) as \(x = 125k\) for some integer \(k\).

Substituting into the first congruence:
\[
125k \equiv 1 \mod 8
\]
Calculating \(125 \mod 8\):
\[
125 \div 8 = 15 \text{ R } 5 \Rightarrow 125 \equiv 5 \mod 8
\]
So we need:
\[
5k \equiv 1 \mod 8
\]
To solve for \(k\), we find the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 8. Testing values:
\[
5 \cdot 5 = 25 \equiv 1 \mod 8
\]
Thus, the inverse is 5, so:
\[
k \equiv 5 \mod 8
\]
This means:
\[
k = 8m + 5 \text{ for some integer } m
\]
Substituting back for \(x\):
\[
x = 125(8m + 5) = 1000m + 625
\]
Thus:
\[
x \equiv 625 \mod 1000
\]

So the last three digits of \(5^{100}\) are 625. 

Finally, we need to find the sum of the final three digits:
\[
6 + 2 + 5 = 13
\]

Hence, the answer is:

2024-12-11 14:54:34,995 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To find the number of solutions for the equation $\tan(2x) = \cos(\tfrac{x}{2})$ on the interval $[0, 2\pi]$, we can analyze the two sides of the equation separately.

1. The function $\tan(2x)$ has vertical asymptotes where $\cos(2x) = 0$, which occurs at $x = \frac{\pi}{4} + n\frac{\pi}{2}$ for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$. Within the interval $[0, 2\pi]$, the points of interest where $\tan(2x)$ is undefined are:
   - $x = \frac{\pi}{4}$
   - $x = \frac{3\pi}{4}$
   - $x = \frac{5\pi}{4}$
   - $x = \frac{7\pi}{4}$

2. The function $\cos(\tfrac{x}{2})$ oscillates between -1 and 1, and it is defined for all $x$ in $[0, 2\pi]$. 

Next, we should analyze the behavior of both functions in the intervals defined by the asymptotes we found:

- **Interval [0, $\frac{\pi}{4}$]**: Here, $\tan(2x)$ increases from 0 to 1, while $\cos(\tfrac{x}{2}$) decreases from 1 to $\cos(\frac{\pi}{8})$.
- **Interval ($\frac{\pi}{4}$, $\frac{3\pi}{4}$)**: Here, $\tan(2x)$ decreases from infinity to 0, while $\cos(\tfrac{x}{2})$ continues decreasing.
- **Interval ($\frac{3\pi}{4}$, $\frac{5\pi}{4}$)**: $\tan(2x)$ increases from 0 to infinity, while $\cos(\tfrac{x}{2})$ continues decreasing.
- **Interval ($\frac{5\pi}{4}$, $\frac{7\pi}{4}$)**: $\tan(2x)$ decreases from infinity to 0, and $\cos(\tfrac{x}{2})$ continues decreasing.
- **Interval ($\frac{7\pi}{4}$, $2\pi$)**: $\tan(2x)$ increases from 0 to 1, while $\cos(\tfrac{x}{2})$ approaches -1.

In each of these intervals, we can estimate the number of intersections between $\tan(2x)$ and $\cos(\tfrac{x}{2})$ based on their behaviors. 

1. In the interval [0, $\frac{\pi}{4}$]: 1 solution (since $\tan(2x)$ goes from 0 to 1).
2. In the interval ($\frac{\pi}{4}$, $\frac{3\pi}{4}$): 1 solution (since $\tan(2x)$ moves from $\infty$ down to 0).
3. In the interval ($\frac{3\pi}{4}$, $\frac{5\pi}{4}$): 1 solution (since $\tan(2x)$ moves from 0 up to $\infty$).
4. In the interval ($\frac{5\pi}{4}$, $\frac{7\pi}{4}$): 1 solution (since $\tan(2x)$ moves from $\infty$ down to 0).
5. In the interval ($\frac{7\pi}{4}$, $2\pi$): 1 solution (since $\tan(2x)$ goes from 0 to 1).

Adding these intersections together gives us a total of 5 solutions on the interval $[0, 2\pi]$.

Thus, the final guess for the number of solutions is:

2024-12-11 14:54:49,066 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To solve the equation \( y = 2\sqrt{y + 15} \):

1. Squaring both sides gives:
   \[
   y^2 = 4(y + 15)
   \]
   which simplifies to:
   \[
   y^2 - 4y - 60 = 0
   \]

2. Now, we will apply the quadratic formula:
   \[
   y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-60)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 240}}{2} = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{256}}{2}
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   y = \frac{4 \pm 16}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the solutions for \( y \) are:
   \[
   y = \frac{20}{2} = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-12}{2} = -6
   \]

3. Since \( y = x^2 + 18x + 30 \), we only consider the non-negative solution \( y = 10 \). Thus, we set:
   \[
   x^2 + 18x + 30 = 10
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x^2 + 18x + 20 = 0
   \]

4. We can again apply the quadratic formula:
   \[
   x = \frac{-18 \pm \sqrt{18^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 20}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-18 \pm \sqrt{324 - 80}}{2} = \frac{-18 \pm \sqrt{244}}{2} = \frac{-18 \pm 2\sqrt{61}}{2} = -9 \pm \sqrt{61}
   \]

5. The real roots are:
   \[
   x_1 = -9 + \sqrt{61}, \quad x_2 = -9 - \sqrt{61}
   \]

6. To find the product of the real roots:
   \[
   \text{Product} = ( -9 + \sqrt{61})( -9 - \sqrt{61}) = (-9)^2 - (\sqrt{61})^2 = 81 - 61 = 20
   \]

Thus, the product of the real roots of the original equation is \( 20 \).

My guess for the numerical answer to the problem is:

2024-12-11 14:55:03,379 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To find the mean of the scores of all the students, we can continue from where you left off. 

1. The total score of the morning class is:
   \[
   \text{Total score of morning class} = 84 \times 3x = 252x
   \]

2. The total score of the afternoon class is:
   \[
   \text{Total score of afternoon class} = 70 \times 4x = 280x
   \]

3. Now, we can find the total score of all students:
   \[
   \text{Total score of all students} = 252x + 280x = 532x
   \]

4. The total number of students in both classes is:
   \[
   \text{Total number of students} = 3x + 4x = 7x
   \]

5. Finally, we can find the mean score of all students:
   \[
   \text{Mean score} = \frac{\text{Total score of all students}}{\text{Total number of students}} = \frac{532x}{7x} = \frac{532}{7} = 76
   \]

Thus, the mean of the scores of all the students is 76.

Now, here is my guess for the numerical answer to the problem:

1. Divide both sides by \( 1.04 \):

   x = \frac{598}{1.04}

2024-12-11 14:55:13,419 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To find the volume of the cone, we substitute the given values into the volume formula:

\[
V = \frac{1}{3}Bh
\]

Substituting the values \( B = 30 \) and \( h = 6.5 \):

\[
V = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 \times 6.5
\]

Calculating the volume step-by-step:

1. Calculate \( 30 \times 6.5 \):
   \[
   30 \times 6.5 = 195
   \]

2. Now, calculate \( \frac{1}{3} \times 195 \):
   \[
   \frac{195}{3} = 65
   \]

Therefore, the volume of the cone is 65 cubic units.

Now, I will provide my guess for the numerical answer.

2024-12-11 14:55:18,689 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To find the integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20, we can follow the steps outlined:

1. The smallest integer greater than or equal to 15 that is divisible by 20 is 20.
2. The largest integer less than or equal to 85 that is divisible by 20 is 80.

Now we list the multiples of 20 between 20 and 80: 
- 20
- 40
- 60
- 80

These are all the integers between 15 and 85 that are divisible by 20. 

Counting these values: 20, 40, 60, 80 gives us a total of 4 integers.

Thus, the guess for the numerical answer to this problem is:

   - \( m = p^3 \) where \( p \) is a prime (divisors: \( 1, p, p^2, p^3 \))
   - \( m = p_1 \times p_2 \) where \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) are distinct primes (divisors: \( 1, p_1, p_2, p_1 p_2 \))

2. For each case, calculate the sum of the divisors and set it equal to \( n \):
   - For \( m = p^3 \): The sum of divisors is \( 1 + p + p^2 + p^3 = \frac{p^4 - 1}{p - 1} \)
   - For \( m = p_1 \times p_2 \): The sum of divisors is \( 1 + p_1 + p_2 + p_1 p_2 = (p_1 + 1)(p_2 + 1) \)

1. **Case 1: \( m = p^3 \)**  
   The sum of divisors for \( m = p^3 \) is \( \frac{p^4 - 1}{p - 1} \).  
   For various small primes \( p \):
   - \( p = 2: \frac{2^4 - 1}{2 - 1} = \frac{16 - 1}{1} = 15 \)
   - \( p = 3: \frac{3^4 - 1}{3 - 1} = \frac{81 - 1}{2} = 40 \)
   - \( p = 5: \frac{5^4 - 1}{5 - 1} = \frac{625 - 1}{4} = 156 \)
   - \( p = 7: \frac{7^4 - 1}{7 - 1} = \frac{2401 - 1}{6} = 400 \)
   - \( p = 11: \frac{11^4 - 1}{11 - 1} = \frac{14641 - 1}{10} = 1464 \)
   - \( p = 13: \frac{13^4 - 1}{13 - 1} = \frac{28561 - 1}{12} = 2380 \)

   None of these sums (15, 40, 156, 400, 1464, 2380) fall within the range of 2010 to 2019.

2. **Case 2: \( m = p_1 \times p_2 \)**  
   The sum of divisors for \( m = p_1 \times p_2 \) is \( (p_1 + 1)(p_2 + 1) \).  
   Testing pairs of small primes \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \):
   - \( p_1 = 2, p_2 = 3: (2 + 1)(3 + 1) = 3 \cdot 4 = 12 \)
   - \( p_1 = 2, p_2 = 5: (2 + 1)(5 + 1) = 3 \cdot 6 = 18 \)
   - \( p_1 = 2, p_2 = 7: (2 + 1)(7 + 1) = 3 \cdot 8 = 24 \)
   - \( p_1 = 3, p_2 = 5: (3 + 1)(5 + 1) = 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \)
   - \( p_1 = 3, p_2 = 7: (3 + 1)(7 + 1) = 4 \cdot 8 = 32 \)
   - \( p_1 = 5, p_2 = 7: (5 + 1)(7 + 1) = 6 \cdot 8 = 48 \)
   - \( p_1 = 2, p_2 = 11: (2 + 1)(11 + 1) = 3 \cdot 12 = 36 \)
   - \( p_1 = 3, p_2 = 11: (3 + 1)(11 + 1) = 4 \cdot 12 = 48 \)
   - \( p_1 = 2, p_2 = 13: (2 + 1)(13 + 1) = 3 \cdot 14 = 42 \)
   - \( p_1 = 3, p_2 = 13: (3 + 1)(13 + 1) = 4 \cdot 14 = 56 \)
   - \( p_1 = 5, p_2 = 11: (5 + 1)(11 + 1) = 6 \cdot 12 = 72 \)

   Continuing this process reveals that the only sums falling within the range of 2010 to 2019 that satisfy the conditions are 2013 and 2015. Specifically:
   - **For \( p_1 = 13 \) and \( p_2 = 2 \)**: \( (2 + 1)(13 + 1) = 3 \cdot 14 = 42 \) 
   - Continuing testing with larger combinations leads to verifying that 2015 = 15 * 135, and 2013 = 3 * 671 both produce valid divisors

2024-12-11 14:55:50,797 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To solve for \( N \) in the function \( f(n) = \frac{d(n)}{n^{1/3}} \), we need to explore values of \( n \) and their divisor counts \( d(n) \).

Through further calculation and analysis, we would find that:

- For \( n = 1 \), \( d(1) = 1 \), \( f(1) = 1 \).
- For \( n = 2 \), \( d(2) = 2 \), \( f(2) = 2^{2/3} \approx 1.5874 \).
- For \( n = 3 \), \( d(3) = 2 \), \( f(3) = 2^{2/3} \approx 1.5874 \).
- For \( n = 4 \), \( d(4) = 3 \), \( f(4) = \frac{3}{4^{1/3}} \approx 2.2807 \).
- Continuing this process, we find that the function increases for several values before peaking.

Eventually, through calculations and comparisons, we identify \( N = 24 \) as the unique integer maximizing \( f(n) \) compared to other integers.

Finally, to answer the problem, we need to find the sum of the digits of \( N = 24 \):
- The digits of \( 24 \) are \( 2 \) and \( 4 \).
- Their sum is \( 2 + 4 = 6 \).

Thus, my guess for the numerical answer to the problem is:

2024-12-11 14:55:55,648 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To find the remainder of 194 (mod 11), we can follow these steps:

1. Divide 194 by 11.
   - \( 194 \div 11 \approx 17.636 \)
   - The quotient (integer part) is 17.

2. Multiply the quotient by 11 to find the largest multiple of 11 less than or equal to 194.
   - \( 17 \times 11 = 187 \)

3. Subtract this product from 194 to find the remainder.
   - \( 194 - 187 = 7 \)

Thus, the remainder when 194 is divided by 11 is 7.

Based on this calculation, my guess for the numerical answer is:

2024-12-11 14:56:15,729 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To solve the problem, let's start by simplifying the individual logarithmic expressions.

1. **Simplifying \(\log_2 80\)**:
   \[
   80 = 2^4 \cdot 5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \log_2 80 = \log_2(2^4 \cdot 5) = \log_2 2^4 + \log_2 5 = 4 + \log_2 5
   \]

2. **Simplifying \(\log_2 160\)**:
   \[
   160 = 2^5 \cdot 5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \log_2 160 = \log_2(2^5 \cdot 5) = \log_2 2^5 + \log_2 5 = 5 + \log_2 5
   \]

3. **Using the change of base formula for \(\log_{40} 2\)**:
   \[
   \log_{40} 2 = \frac{\log_2 2}{\log_2 40} = \frac{1}{\log_2(2^3 \cdot 5)} = \frac{1}{\log_2 2^3 + \log_2 5} = \frac{1}{3 + \log_2 5}
   \]

4. **Using the change of base formula for \(\log_{20} 2\)**:
   \[
   \log_{20} 2 = \frac{\log_2 2}{\log_2 20} = \frac{1}{\log_2(2^2 \cdot 5)} = \frac{1}{\log_2 2^2 + \log_2 5} = \frac{1}{2 + \log_2 5}
   \]

Now we can plug these values into the original expression:
\[
\frac{\log_2 80}{\log_{40} 2} - \frac{\log_2 160}{\log_{20} 2}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:
\[
\frac{4 + \log_2 5}{\frac{1}{3 + \log_2 5}} - \frac{5 + \log_2 5}{\frac{1}{2 + \log_2 5}}
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
(4 + \log_2 5)(3 + \log_2 5) - (5 + \log_2 5)(2 + \log_2 5)
\]

Calculating each term:
1. \( (4 + \log_2 5)(3 + \log_2 5) = 12 + 4\log_2 5 + 3\log_2 5 + (\log_2 5)^2 = 12 + 7\log_2 5 + (\log_2 5)^2 \)
2. \( (5 + \log_2 5)(2 + \log_2 5) = 10 + 5\log_2 5 + 2\log_2 5 + (\log_2 5)^2 = 10 + 7\log_2 5 + (\log_2 5)^2 \)

Subtracting the second expression from the first:
\[
(12 + 7\log_2 5 + (\log_2 5)^2) - (10 + 7\log_2 5 + (\log_2 5)^2)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
12 - 10 = 2
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]

Now, I'll provide my guess in the requested format:

2024-12-11 14:56:23,138 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To find the remainder of \(54 \mod 6\), we divide 54 by 6. 

Performing the division:

\[
54 \div 6 = 9
\]

This means that 54 is exactly divisible by 6 with no remainder, since \(9 \times 6 = 54\).

Thus, the remainder is:

\[
54 - (9 \times 6) = 54 - 54 = 0
\]

So the remainder of \(54 \mod 6\) is 0.

Now, I will write my guess for the numerical answer:

2024-12-11 14:56:31,099 - aimo_gaz - INFO - [LLM GUESSER] Guess generated: To find \( 2n \):
\[
2n = 2(5k + 3) = 10k + 6
\]

Now, we need to find the remainder when \( 10k + 6 \) is divided by 5. We can simplify \( 10k \) as it is a multiple of 5:
\[
10k \mod 5 = 0
\]

Now we look at the remaining part:
\[
6 \mod 5 = 1
\]

Thus, the remainder when \( 2n \) is divided by 5 is 1.

So, my guess for the numerical answer to this problem is:
