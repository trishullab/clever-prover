Example problem:
What is x in the equation $x + 20 = 2 * x - 10$?

Example solution:
[STEPS]
We can group together the terms with variable x.
So we have equation $20 = 2 * x - x - 10$. Now we can group together the constant terms to simplify the equation to $20 + 10 = 2 * x - x$. On simplification, we get $30 = x$. So we know that x is 30.

[ANSWER]
30
